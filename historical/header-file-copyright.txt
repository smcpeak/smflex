header-file-copyright.txt
-------------------------

The header file generated by smflex does not carry a copyright notice
or other usage restrictions.  This document explains that fact.

I, Scott McPeak, claim full and sole authorship of generated-header.skl,
the file that serves as the basis for the generated header.  Therefore
I claim the right to declare it free of copyright and contribute it to
the public domain, and I have done so.

Some may question this, since flex-2.5.4 includes FlexLexer.h, and
FlexLexer.h carries a BSD copyright notice and license, so let me
answer that putative question.

First, again, I wrote generated-header.skl.  Now, it was not written in
a "clean room" style; in fact, as the revision history shows, I
gradually rewrote FlexLexer.h.  But as that same history shows, over a
span of two weeks, I replaced everything that was in that file.  The
current generated-header.skl is entirely the result of, albeit piece by
piece, discarding what was there and making new choices.  Both
FlexLexer.h and generated-header.skl are derivative works of flex-2.5.4
"flex.skl", in that they encapsulate the scanner state originally
defined there, but I claim that the latter is not a derivative work of
the former.

Second, the COPYING file in flex-2.5.4 contains this language:

  Note that the "flex.skl" scanner skeleton carries no copyright notice.
  You are free to do whatever you please with scanners generated using flex;
  for them, you are not even bound by the above copyright.

This makes it clear that the intent is for generated scanners to have
no copyright encumbrance.  Yet C++-interface scanners generated by
flex-2.5.4 must be compiled with FlexLexer.h.  Therefore I have a good
faith belief that the authors intended FlexLexer.h to be similarly
unencumbered.

So, to summarize, the legal theory behind my claim is:

1. generated-header.skl is my original work, derivative only of
   flex.skl, itself free from copyright claims.

2. Even if my work is determined to be derivative of FlexLexer.h, I
   believe that file was meant to be unencumbered by copyright.

However, I am not a lawyer, I am not your lawyer, and I am not promising
to pay your legal fees or damages if the UC Regents or anyone else sues
you.  This document is simply my explanation for the state of affairs
and my actions leading to that state.
