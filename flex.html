<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p><code>flex</code> is a tool for generating <em>scanners</em>: programs
which recognized lexical patterns in text. <code>flex</code> reads the
given input files, or its standard input if no file names are given, for
a description of a scanner to generate. The description is in the form
of pairs of regular expressions and C code, called <em>rules</em>.  <code>flex</code>
generates as output a C source file, <code>lex.yy.c</code>, which
defines a routine <code>yylex()</code>. This file is compiled and linked
with the <code>-lfl</code> library to produce an executable. When the
executable is run, it analyzes its input for occurrences of the regular
expressions. Whenever it finds one, it executes the corresponding C code.

<h1 id="some-simple-examples">SOME SIMPLE EXAMPLES</h1>

<p>First some simple examples to get the flavor of how one uses
<code>flex</code>. The following <code>flex</code> input specifies a
scanner which whenever it encounters the string "username" will replace
it with the user's login name:

<pre><code>
    %%
    username    printf( &quot;%s&quot;, getlogin() );
</code></pre>

<p>By default, any text not matched by a <code>flex</code> scanner is
copied to the output, so the net effect of this scanner is to copy its
input file to its output with each occurrence of "username" expanded. In
this input, there is just one rule. "username" is the <em>pattern</em>
and the "printf" is the <em>action</em>. The "%%" marks the beginning
of the rules.

<p>Here's another simple example:

<pre><code>
            int num_lines = 0, num_chars = 0;

    %%
    \n      ++num_lines; ++num_chars;
    .       ++num_chars;

    %%
    main()
            {
            yylex();
            printf( &quot;# of lines = %d, # of chars = %d\n&quot;,
                    num_lines, num_chars );
            }
</code></pre>

<p>This scanner counts the number of characters and the number of
lines in its input (it produces no output other than the final report
on the counts). The first line declares two globals, "num_lines" and
"num_chars", which are accessible both inside <code>yylex()</code> and
in the <code>main()</code> routine declared after the second "%%". There
are two rules, one which matches a newline ("\n") and increments both the
line count and the character count, and one which matches any character
other than a newline (indicated by the "." regular expression).

<p>A somewhat more complicated example:

<pre><code>
    /* scanner for a toy Pascal-like language */

    %{
    /* need this for the call to atof() below */
    #include &lt;math.h&gt;
    %}

    DIGIT    [0-9]
    ID       [a-z][a-z0-9]*

    %%

    {DIGIT}+    {
                printf( &quot;An integer: %s (%d)\n&quot;, yytext,
                        atoi( yytext ) );
                }

    {DIGIT}+&quot;.&quot;{DIGIT}*        {
                printf( &quot;A float: %s (%g)\n&quot;, yytext,
                        atof( yytext ) );
                }

    if|then|begin|end|procedure|function        {
                printf( &quot;A keyword: %s\n&quot;, yytext );
                }

    {ID}        printf( &quot;An identifier: %s\n&quot;, yytext );

    &quot;+&quot;|&quot;-&quot;|&quot;*&quot;|&quot;/&quot;   printf( &quot;An operator: %s\n&quot;, yytext );

    &quot;{&quot;[^}\n]*&quot;}&quot;     /* eat up one-line comments */

    [ \t\n]+          /* eat up whitespace */

    .           printf( &quot;Unrecognized character: %s\n&quot;, yytext );

    %%

    main( argc, argv )
    int argc;
    char **argv;
        {
        ++argv, --argc;  /* skip over program name */
        if ( argc &gt; 0 )
                yyin = fopen( argv[0], &quot;r&quot; );
        else
                yyin = stdin;
        
        yylex();
        }
</code></pre>

<p>This is the beginnings of a simple scanner for a language like
Pascal. It identifies different types of <em>tokens</em> and reports on
what it has seen.

<p>The details of this example will be explained in the following
sections.

<h1 id="format-of-the-input-file">FORMAT OF THE INPUT FILE</h1>

<p>The <code>flex</code> input file consists of three sections, separated
by a line with just <code>%%</code> in it:

<pre><code>
    definitions
    %%
    rules
    %%
    user code
</code></pre>

<p>The <em>definitions</em> section contains declarations of simple
<em>name</em> definitions to simplify the scanner specification, and
declarations of <em>start conditions</em>, which are explained in the
<a href="#start-conditions">Start Conditions</a> section.

<p>Name definitions have the form:

<pre><code>
    name definition
</code></pre>

<p>The "name" is a word beginning with a letter or an underscore ('_')
followed by zero or more letters, digits, '_', or '-' (dash). The
definition is taken to begin at the first non-white-space character
following the name and continuing to the end of the line. The definition
can subsequently be referred to using "{name}", which will expand to
"(definition)". For example,

<pre><code>
    DIGIT    [0-9]
    ID       [a-z][a-z0-9]*
</code></pre>

<p>defines "DIGIT" to be a regular expression which matches a single
digit, and "ID" to be a regular expression which matches a letter followed
by zero-or-more letters-or-digits. A subsequent reference to

<pre><code>
    {DIGIT}+&quot;.&quot;{DIGIT}*
</code></pre>

<p>is identical to

<pre><code>
    ([0-9])+&quot;.&quot;([0-9])*
</code></pre>

<p>and matches one-or-more digits followed by a '.' followed by
zero-or-more digits.

<p>The <em>rules</em> section of the <code>flex</code> input contains
a series of rules of the form:

<pre><code>
    pattern   action
</code></pre>

<p>where the pattern must be unindented and the action must begin on
the same line.

<p>See below for a further description of patterns and actions.

<p>Finally, the user code section is simply copied to
<code>lex.yy.c</code> verbatim. It is used for companion routines
which call or are called by the scanner. The presence of this section
is optional; if it is missing, the second <code>%%</code> in the input
file may be skipped, too.

<p>In the definitions and rules sections, any <em>indented</em> text or
text enclosed in <code>%{</code> and <code>%}</code> is copied verbatim
to the output (with the %{}'s removed). The %{}'s must appear unindented
on lines by themselves.

<p>In the rules section, any indented or %{} text appearing before
the first rule may be used to declare variables which are local to the
scanning routine and (after the declarations) code which is to be executed
whenever the scanning routine is entered. Other indented or %{} text in
the rule section is still copied to the output, but its meaning is not
well-defined and it may well cause compile-time errors (this feature is
present for <em>POSIX</em> compliance; see below for other such features).

<p>In the definitions section (but not in the rules section), an
unindented comment (i.e., a line beginning with "/*") is also copied
verbatim to the output up to the next "*/".

<h1 id="patterns">PATTERNS</h1>

<p>The patterns in the input are written using an extended set of regular
expressions. These are:

<pre><code>
    x          match the character &#39;x&#39;
    .          any character (byte) except newline
    [xyz]      a &quot;character class&quot;; in this case, the pattern
                 matches either an &#39;x&#39;, a &#39;y&#39;, or a &#39;z&#39;
    [abj-oZ]   a &quot;character class&quot; with a range in it; matches
                 an &#39;a&#39;, a &#39;b&#39;, any letter from &#39;j&#39; through &#39;o&#39;,
                 or a &#39;Z&#39;
    [^A-Z]     a &quot;negated character class&quot;, i.e., any character
                 but those in the class.  In this case, any
                 character EXCEPT an uppercase letter.
    [^A-Z\n]   any character EXCEPT an uppercase letter or
                 a newline
    r*         zero or more r&#39;s, where r is any regular expression
    r+         one or more r&#39;s
    r?         zero or one r&#39;s (that is, &quot;an optional r&quot;)
    r{2,5}     anywhere from two to five r&#39;s
    r{2,}      two or more r&#39;s
    r{4}       exactly 4 r&#39;s
    {name}     the expansion of the &quot;name&quot; definition
               (see above)
    &quot;[xyz]\&quot;foo&quot;
               the literal string: [xyz]&quot;foo
    \X         if X is an &#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;f&#39;, &#39;n&#39;, &#39;r&#39;, &#39;t&#39;, or &#39;v&#39;,
                 then the ANSI-C interpretation of \x.
                 Otherwise, a literal &#39;X&#39; (used to escape
                 operators such as &#39;*&#39;)
    \0         a NUL character (ASCII code 0)
    \123       the character with octal value 123
    \x2a       the character with hexadecimal value 2a
    (r)        match an r; parentheses are used to override
                 precedence (see below)


    rs         the regular expression r followed by the
                 regular expression s; called &quot;concatenation&quot;


    r|s        either an r or an s


    r/s        an r but only if it is followed by an s.  The
                 text matched by s is included when determining
                 whether this rule is the &quot;longest match&quot;,
                 but is then returned to the input before
                 the action is executed.  So the action only
                 sees the text matched by r.  This type
                 of pattern is called trailing context&quot;.
                 (There are some combinations of r/s that flex
                 cannot match correctly; see notes in the
                 Deficiencies / Bugs section below regarding
                 &quot;dangerous trailing context&quot;.)
    ^r         an r, but only at the beginning of a line (i.e.,
                 which just starting to scan, or right after a
                 newline has been scanned).
    r$         an r, but only at the end of a line (i.e., just
                 before a newline).  Equivalent to &quot;r/\n&quot;.

               Note that flex&#39;s notion of &quot;newline&quot; is exactly
               whatever the C compiler used to compile flex
               interprets &#39;\n&#39; as; in particular, on some DOS
               systems you must either filter out \r&#39;s in the
               input yourself, or explicitly use r/\r\n for &quot;r$&quot;.


    &lt;s&gt;r       an r, but only in start condition s (see
                 <a href="#start-conditions">Start Conditions</a>)
    &lt;s1,s2,s3&gt;r
               same, but in any of start conditions s1,
                 s2, or s3
    &lt;*&gt;r       an r in any start condition, even an exclusive one.


    &lt;&lt;EOF&gt;&gt;    an end-of-file
    &lt;s1,s2&gt;&lt;&lt;EOF&gt;&gt;
               an end-of-file when in start condition s1 or s2
</code></pre>

<p>Note that inside of a character class, all regular expression operators
lose their special meaning except escape ('\') and the character class
operators, '-', ']', and, at the beginning of the class, '^'.

<p>The regular expressions listed above are grouped according to
precedence, from highest precedence at the top to lowest at the
bottom. Those grouped together have equal precedence. For example,

<pre><code>
    foo|bar*
</code></pre>

<p>is the same as

<pre><code>
    (foo)|(ba(r*))
</code></pre>

<p>since the '*' operator has higher precedence than concatenation,
and concatenation higher than alternation ('|'). This pattern therefore
matches <em>either</em> the string "foo" <em>or</em> the string "ba"
followed by zero-or-more r's. To match "foo" or zero-or-more "bar"'s, use:

<pre><code>
    foo|(bar)*
</code></pre>

<p>and to match zero-or-more "foo"'s-or-"bar"'s:

<pre><code>
    (foo|bar)*
</code></pre>

<p>In addition to characters and ranges of characters, character
classes can also contain character class <em>expressions</em>. These
are expressions enclosed inside <code>[:</code> and <code>:]</code>
delimiters (which themselves must appear between the '[' and ']' of the
character class; other elements may occur inside the character class,
too). The valid expressions are:

<pre><code>
    [:alnum:] [:alpha:] [:blank:]
    [:cntrl:] [:digit:] [:graph:]
    [:lower:] [:print:] [:punct:]
    [:space:] [:upper:] [:xdigit:]
</code></pre>

<p>These expressions all designate a set of characters equivalent
to the corresponding standard C <code>isXXX</code> function. For
example, <code>[:alnum:]</code> designates those characters for
which <code>isalnum()</code> returns true - i.e., any alphabetic or
numeric. Some systems don't provide <code>isblank()</code>, so flex
defines <code>[:blank:]</code> as a blank or a tab.

<p>For example, the following character classes are all equivalent:

<pre><code>
    [[:alnum:]]
    [[:alpha:][:digit:]
    [[:alpha:]0-9]
    [a-zA-Z0-9]
</code></pre>

<p>If your scanner is case-insensitive (the <code>-i</code> flag),
then <code>[:upper:]</code> and <code>[:lower:]</code> are equivalent
to <code>[:alpha:]</code>.

<p>Some notes on patterns:

<ul>

<li><p>A negated character class such as the example "[^A-Z]" above
    <em>will match a newline</em> unless "\n" (or an equivalent escape
    sequence) is one of the characters explicitly present in the negated
    character class (e.g., "[^A-Z\n]"). This is unlike how many other
    regular expression tools treat negated character classes, but
    unfortunately the inconsistency is historically entrenched. Matching
    newlines means that a pattern like [^"]* can match the entire input
    unless there's another quote in the input.

<li><p>A rule can have at most one instance of trailing context (the
    '/' operator or the '$' operator). The start condition, '^', and
    "&lt;&lt;EOF&gt;&gt;" patterns can only occur at the beginning of a
    pattern, and, as well as with '/' and '$', cannot be grouped inside
    parentheses. A '^' which does not occur at the beginning of a rule or a
    '$' which does not occur at the end of a rule loses its special properties
    and is treated as a normal character.

</ul>

<p>The following are illegal:

<pre><code>
    foo/bar$
    &lt;sc1&gt;foo&lt;sc2&gt;bar
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the first of these, can be written "foo/bar\n".

<p>The following will result in '$' or '^' being treated as a normal
character:

<pre><code>
    foo|(bar$)
    foo|^bar
</code></pre>

<p>If what's wanted is a "foo" or a bar-followed-by-a-newline, the
following could be used (the special '|' action is explained below):

<pre><code>
    foo      |
    bar$     /* action goes here */
</code></pre>

<p>A similar trick will work for matching a foo or a
bar-at-the-beginning-of-a-line.

<h1 id="how-the-input-is-matched">HOW THE INPUT IS MATCHED</h1>

<p>When the generated scanner is run, it analyzes its input looking for
strings which match any of its patterns. If it finds more than one match,
it takes the one matching the most text (for trailing context rules,
this includes the length of the trailing part, even though it will
then be returned to the input). If it finds two or more matches of the
same length, the rule listed first in the <code>flex</code> input file
is chosen.

<p>Once the match is determined, the text corresponding to the match
(called the <em>token</em>) is made available in the global character
pointer <code>yytext</code>, and its length in the global integer
<code>yyleng</code>. The <em>action</em> corresponding to the matched
pattern is then executed (a more detailed description of actions follows),
and then the remaining input is scanned for another match.

<p>If no match is found, then the <em>default rule</em> is executed:
the next character in the input is considered matched and copied to the
standard output. Thus, the simplest legal <code>flex</code> input is:

<pre><code>
    %%
</code></pre>

<p>which generates a scanner that simply copies its input (one character
at a time) to its output.

<p>Note that <code>yytext</code> can be defined in two different
ways: either as a character <em>pointer</em> or as a character
<em>array</em>. You can control which definition <code>flex</code>
uses by including one of the special directives <code>%pointer</code>
or <code>%array</code> in the first (definitions) section of
your flex input. The default is <code>%pointer</code>, unless
you use the <code>-l</code> lex compatibility option, in which
case <code>yytext</code> will be an array. The advantage of using
<code>%pointer</code> is substantially faster scanning and no buffer
overflow when matching very large tokens (unless you run out of dynamic
memory). The disadvantage is that you are restricted in how your actions
can modify <code>yytext</code> (see the next section), and calls to
the <code>unput()</code> function destroys the present contents of
<code>yytext</code>, which can be a considerable porting headache when
moving between different <code>lex</code> versions.

<p>The advantage of <code>%array</code> is that you can then
modify <code>yytext</code> to your heart's content, and calls
to <code>unput()</code> do not destroy <code>yytext</code> (see
below). Furthermore, existing <code>lex</code> programs sometimes access
<code>yytext</code> externally using declarations of the form:

<pre><code>    extern char yytext[];</code></pre>

<p>This definition is erroneous when used with <code>%pointer</code>,
but correct for <code>%array</code>.

<p><code>%array</code> defines <code>yytext</code> to be an array
of <code>YYLMAX</code> characters, which defaults to a fairly large
value. You can change the size by simply #define'ing <code>YYLMAX</code>
to a different value in the first section of your <code>flex</code>
input. As mentioned above, with <code>%pointer</code> yytext grows
dynamically to accommodate large tokens. While this means your
<code>%pointer</code> scanner can accommodate very large tokens (such
as matching entire blocks of comments), bear in mind that each time
the scanner must resize <code>yytext</code> it also must rescan the
entire token from the beginning, so matching such tokens can prove
slow. <code>yytext</code> presently does <em>not</em> dynamically grow
if a call to <code>unput()</code> results in too much text being pushed
back; instead, a run-time error results.

<p>Also note that you cannot use <code>%array</code> with C++ scanner
classes (the <code>c++</code> option; see below).

<h1 id="actions">ACTIONS</h1>

<p>Each pattern in a rule has a corresponding action, which can be
any arbitrary C statement. The pattern ends at the first non-escaped
whitespace character; the remainder of the line is its action. If the
action is empty, then when the pattern is matched the input token is
simply discarded. For example, here is the specification for a program
which deletes all occurrences of "zap me" from its input:

<pre><code>
    %%
    &quot;zap me&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>(It will copy all other characters in the input to the output since
they will be matched by the default rule.)

<p>Here is a program which compresses multiple blanks and tabs down to
a single blank, and throws away whitespace found at the end of a line:

<pre><code>
    %%
    [ \t]+        putchar( &#39; &#39; );
    [ \t]+$       /* ignore this token */
</code></pre>

<p>If the action contains a '{', then the action spans till the balancing
'}' is found, and the action may cross multiple lines. <code>flex</code>
knows about C strings and comments and won't be fooled by braces found
within them, but also allows actions to begin with <code>%{</code> and
will consider the action to be all the text up to the next <code>%}</code>
(regardless of ordinary braces inside the action).

<p>An action consisting solely of a vertical bar ('|') means "same as
the action for the next rule." See below for an illustration.

<p>Actions can include arbitrary C code, including <code>return</code>
statements to return a value to whatever routine called
<code>yylex()</code>. Each time <code>yylex()</code> is called it
continues processing tokens from where it last left off until it either
reaches the end of the file or executes a return.

<p>Actions are free to modify <code>yytext</code> except for
lengthening it (adding characters to its end--these will overwrite
later characters in the input stream). This however does not apply when
using <code>%array</code> (see above); in that case, <code>yytext</code>
may be freely modified in any way.

<p>Actions are free to modify <code>yyleng</code> except they should
not do so if the action also includes use of <code>yymore()</code>
(see below).

<p>There are a number of special directives which can be included within
an action:

<ul>

<li><p><code>ECHO</code> copies yytext to the scanner's output.

<li><p><code>BEGIN</code> followed by the name of a
    <a href="#start-conditions">start condition</a>
    places the scanner in the corresponding start condition.

<li><p><code>REJECT</code>
    directs the scanner to proceed on to the "second best" rule which
    matched the input (or a prefix of the input). The rule is chosen as
    described above in "How the Input is Matched", and
    <code>yytext</code> and <code>yyleng</code> set up appropriately. It
    may either be one which matched as much text as the originally
    chosen rule but came later in the <code>flex</code> input file, or
    one which matched less text. For example, the following will both
    count the words in the input and call the routine special() whenever
    "frob" is seen:

    <pre><code>
                int word_count = 0;
        %%

        frob        special(); REJECT;
        [^ \t\n]+   ++word_count;
    </code></pre>

    <p>Without the <code>REJECT</code>, any "frob"'s in the input would not
    be counted as words, since the scanner normally executes only one action
    per token. Multiple <code>REJECT</code>s are allowed, each one finding
    the next best choice to the currently active rule. For example, when
    the following scanner scans the token "abcd", it will write "abcdabcaba"
    to the output:

    <pre><code>
        %%
        a        |
        ab       |
        abc      |
        abcd     ECHO; REJECT;
        .|\n     /* eat up any unmatched character */
    </code></pre>

    <p>(The first three rules share the fourth's action since they use the
    special '|' action.) <code>REJECT</code> is a particularly expensive
    feature in terms of scanner performance; if it is used in <em>any</em>
    of the scanner's actions it will slow down <em>all</em> of the scanner's
    matching. Furthermore, <code>REJECT</code> cannot be used with the
    <code>-Cf</code> or <code>-CF</code> options (see below).

    <p>Note also that unlike the other special actions, <code>REJECT</code>
    is a <em>branch</em>; code immediately following it in the action will
    <em>not</em> be executed.

<li><p><code>yymore()</code>
    tells the scanner that the next time it matches a rule, the
    corresponding token should be <em>appended</em> onto the current
    value of <code>yytext</code> rather than replacing it. For example,
    given the input "mega-kludge" the following will write
    "mega-mega-kludge" to the output:

    <pre><code>
        %%
        mega-    ECHO; yymore();
        kludge   ECHO;
    </code></pre>

    <p>First "mega-" is matched and echoed to the output. Then "kludge"
    is matched, but the previous "mega-" is still hanging around at the
    beginning of <code>yytext</code> so the <code>ECHO</code> for the "kludge"
    rule will actually write "mega-kludge".

    <p>Two notes regarding use of <code>yymore()</code>. First,
    <code>yymore()</code> depends on the value of <code>yyleng</code>
    correctly reflecting the size of the current token, so you must not modify
    <code>yyleng</code> if you are using <code>yymore()</code>. Second,
    the presence of <code>yymore()</code> in the scanner's action entails
    a minor performance penalty in the scanner's matching speed.

<li><p><code>yyless(n)</code>
    returns all but the first <code>n</code> characters of the current
    token back to the input stream, where they will be rescanned when
    the scanner looks for the next match. <code>yytext</code> and
    <code>yyleng</code> are adjusted appropriately (e.g.,
    <code>yyleng</code> will now be equal to <code>n</code> ). For
    example, on the input "foobar" the following will write out
    "foobarbar":

    <pre><code>
        %%
        foobar    ECHO; yyless(3);
        [a-z]+    ECHO;
    </code></pre>

    <p>An argument of 0 to <code>yyless</code> will cause the entire current
    input string to be scanned again. Unless you've changed how the scanner
    will subsequently process its input (using <code>BEGIN</code>, for
    example), this will result in an endless loop.

    <p>Note that <code>yyless</code> is a macro and can only be used in the
    flex input file, not from other source files.

<li><p><code>unput(c)</code>
    puts the character <code>c</code> back onto the input stream. It
    will be the next character scanned. The following action will take
    the current token and cause it to be rescanned enclosed in
    parentheses.

    <pre><code>
        {
        int i;
        /* Copy yytext because unput() trashes yytext */
        char *yycopy = strdup( yytext );
        unput( &#39;)&#39; );
        for ( i = yyleng - 1; i &gt;= 0; --i )
            unput( yycopy[i] );
        unput( &#39;(&#39; );
        free( yycopy );
        }
    </code></pre>

    <p>Note that since each <code>unput()</code> puts the given character
    back at the <em>beginning</em> of the input stream, pushing back strings
    must be done back-to-front.

    <p>An important potential problem when using <code>unput()</code>
    is that if you are using <code>%pointer</code> (the default),
    a call to <code>unput()</code> <em>destroys</em> the contents of
    <code>yytext</code>, starting with its rightmost character and devouring
    one character to the left with each call. If you need the value of yytext
    preserved after a call to <code>unput()</code> (as in the above example),
    you must either first copy it elsewhere, or build your scanner using
    <code>%array</code> instead (see How The Input Is Matched).

    <p>Finally, note that you cannot put back <code>EOF</code> to attempt
    to mark the input stream with an end-of-file.

<li><p><code>input()</code>
    reads the next character from the input stream. For example, the
    following is one way to eat up C comments:

    <pre><code>
        %%
        &quot;/*&quot;        {
                    register int c;

                    for ( ; ; )
                        {
                        while ( (c = input()) != &#39;*&#39; &amp;&amp;
                                c != EOF )
                            ;    /* eat up text of comment */

                        if ( c == &#39;*&#39; )
                            {
                            while ( (c = input()) == &#39;*&#39; )
                                ;
                            if ( c == &#39;/&#39; )
                                break;    /* found the end */
                            }

                        if ( c == EOF )
                            {
                            error( &quot;EOF in comment&quot; );
                            break;
                            }
                        }
                    }
    </code></pre>

    <p>(Note that if the scanner is compiled using <code>C++</code>, then
    <code>input()</code> is instead referred to as <code>yyinput()</code>,
    in order to avoid a name clash with the <code>C++</code> stream by the
    name of <code>input</code>.)

<li><p><code>YY_FLUSH_BUFFER</code>
    flushes the scanner's internal buffer so that the next time the
    scanner attempts to match a token, it will first refill the buffer
    using <code>YY_INPUT</code> (see The Generated Scanner, below). This
    action is a special case of the more general
    <code>yy_flush_buffer()</code> function, described below in the
    section Multiple Input Buffers.

<li><p><code>yyterminate()</code>
    can be used in lieu of a return statement in an action. It
    terminates the scanner and returns a 0 to the scanner's caller,
    indicating "all done". By default, <code>yyterminate()</code> is
    also called when an end-of-file is encountered. It is a macro and
    may be redefined.

</ul>

<h1 id="the-generated-scanner">THE GENERATED SCANNER</h1>

<p>The output of <code>flex</code> is the file <code>lex.yy.c</code>,
which contains the scanning routine <code>yylex()</code>, a number of
tables used by it for matching tokens, and a number of auxiliary routines
and macros. By default, <code>yylex()</code> is declared as follows:

<pre><code>
    int yylex()
        {
        ... various definitions and the actions in here ...
        }
</code></pre>

<p>(If your environment supports function prototypes, then it will be
"int yylex( void )".) This definition may be changed by defining the
"YY_DECL" macro. For example, you could use:

<pre><code>
    #define YY_DECL float lexscan( a, b ) float a, b;
</code></pre>

<p>to give the scanning routine the name <code>lexscan</code>, returning a
float, and taking two floats as arguments. Note that if you give arguments
to the scanning routine using a K&amp;R-style/non-prototyped function
declaration, you must terminate the definition with a semi-colon (;).

<p>Whenever <code>yylex()</code> is called, it scans tokens from the
global input file <code>yyin</code> (which defaults to stdin). It
continues until it either reaches an end-of-file (at which point it
returns the value 0) or one of its actions executes a <code>return</code>
statement.

<p>If the scanner reaches an end-of-file, subsequent calls are undefined
unless either <code>yyin</code> is pointed at a new input file (in which
case scanning continues from that file), or <code>yyrestart()</code>
is called. <code>yyrestart()</code> takes one argument, a <code>FILE
*</code> pointer (which can be nil, if you've set up <code>YY_INPUT</code>
to scan from a source other than <code>yyin</code>), and initializes
<code>yyin</code> for scanning from that file. Essentially there is no
difference between just assigning <code>yyin</code> to a new input file
or using <code>yyrestart()</code> to do so; the latter is available
for compatibility with previous versions of <code>flex</code>,
and because it can be used to switch input files in the middle
of scanning. It can also be used to throw away the current input
buffer, by calling it with an argument of <code>yyin</code>; but
better is to use <code>YY_FLUSH_BUFFER</code> (see above). Note that
<code>yyrestart()</code> does <em>not</em> reset the start condition to
<code>INITIAL</code> (see <a href="#start-conditions">Start Conditions</a>).

<p>If <code>yylex()</code> stops scanning due to executing a
<code>return</code> statement in one of the actions, the scanner may
then be called again and it will resume scanning where it left off.

<p>By default (and for purposes of efficiency), the scanner uses
block-reads rather than simple <code>getc()</code> calls to read
characters from <code>yyin</code>. The nature of how it gets its input
can be controlled by defining the <code>YY_INPUT</code> macro. YY_INPUT's
calling sequence is "YY_INPUT(buf,result,max_size)". Its action is to
place up to <code>max_size</code> characters in the character array
<code>buf</code> and return in the integer variable <code>result</code>
either the number of characters read or the constant YY_NULL (0 on Unix
systems) to indicate EOF. The default YY_INPUT reads from the global
file-pointer "yyin".

<p>A sample definition of YY_INPUT (in the definitions section of the
input file):

<pre><code>
    %{
    #define YY_INPUT(buf,result,max_size) \
        { \
        int c = getchar(); \
        result = (c == EOF) ? YY_NULL : (buf[0] = c, 1); \
        }
    %}
</code></pre>

<p>This definition will change the input processing to occur one character
at a time.

<p>When the scanner receives an end-of-file indication from YY_INPUT,
the scanner terminates, returning 0 to its caller.  The start
condition remains unchanged; it does <em>not</em> revert to
<code>INITIAL</code>.

<p>If you instead want the scanner to continue scanning a new file, as
if its contents came right after the previous one, then set
<a href="#option-yywrap"><code>%option yywrap</code></a>.

<p>Three routines are available for scanning from in-memory buffers rather
than files: <code>yy_scan_string()</code>, <code>yy_scan_bytes()</code>,
and <code>yy_scan_buffer()</code>. See the discussion of them below in
the section <a href="#multiple-input-buffers">Multiple Input Buffers</a>.

<p>The scanner writes its <code>ECHO</code> output to the
<code>yyout</code> global (default, stdout), which may be redefined by
the user simply by assigning it to some other <code>FILE</code> pointer.

<h1 id="start-conditions">START CONDITIONS</h1>

<p><code>flex</code> provides a mechanism for conditionally activating
rules. Any rule whose pattern is prefixed with "&lt;sc&gt;" will only be
active when the scanner is in the start condition named "sc". For example,

<pre><code>
    &lt;STRING&gt;[^&quot;]*        { /* eat up the string body ... */
                ...
                }
</code></pre>

<p>will be active only when the scanner is in the "STRING" start
condition, and

<pre><code>
    &lt;INITIAL,STRING,QUOTE&gt;\.        { /* handle an escape ... */
                ...
                }
</code></pre>

<p>will be active only when the current start condition is either
"INITIAL", "STRING", or "QUOTE".

<p>Start conditions are declared in the definitions (first) section of
the input using unindented lines beginning with either <code>%s</code>
or <code>%x</code> followed by a list of names. The former declares
<em>inclusive</em> start conditions, the latter <em>exclusive</em> start
conditions. A start condition is activated using the <code>BEGIN</code>
action. Until the next <code>BEGIN</code> action is executed, rules
with the given start condition will be active and rules with other start
conditions will be inactive. If the start condition is <em>inclusive</em>,
then rules with no start conditions at all will also be active. If
it is <em>exclusive</em>, then <em>only</em> rules qualified with the
start condition will be active. A set of rules contingent on the same
exclusive start condition describe a scanner which is independent of
any of the other rules in the <code>flex</code> input. Because of this,
exclusive start conditions make it easy to specify "mini-scanners" which
scan portions of the input that are syntactically different from the rest
(e.g., comments).

<p>If the distinction between inclusive and exclusive start conditions is
still a little vague, here's a simple example illustrating the connection
between the two. The set of rules:

<pre><code>
    %s example
    %%

    &lt;example&gt;foo   do_something();

    bar            something_else();
</code></pre>

<p>is equivalent to

<pre><code>
    %x example
    %%

    &lt;example&gt;foo   do_something();

    &lt;INITIAL,example&gt;bar    something_else();
</code></pre>

<p>Without the <code>&lt;INITIAL,example&gt;</code> qualifier, the
<code>bar</code> pattern in the second example wouldn't be active (i.e.,
couldn't match) when in start condition <code>example</code>. If we
just used <code>&lt;example&gt;</code> to qualify <code>bar</code>,
though, then it would only be active in <code>example</code> and not in
<code>INITIAL</code>, while in the first example it's active in both,
because in the first example the <code>example</code> startion condition
is an <em>inclusive</em> <code>(%s)</code> start condition.

<p>Also note that the special start-condition specifier
<code>&lt;*&gt;</code> matches every start condition. Thus, the above
example could also have been written;

<pre><code>
    %x example
    %%

    &lt;example&gt;foo   do_something();

    &lt;*&gt;bar    something_else();
</code></pre>

<p>The default rule (to <code>ECHO</code> any unmatched character)
remains active in start conditions. It is equivalent to:

<pre><code>
    &lt;*&gt;.|\n     ECHO;
</code></pre>

<p><code>BEGIN(0)</code> returns to the original state where only the
rules with no start conditions are active. This state can also be referred
to as the start-condition "INITIAL", so <code>BEGIN(INITIAL)</code> is
equivalent to <code>BEGIN(0)</code>. (The parentheses around the start
condition name are not required but are considered good style.)

<p><code>BEGIN</code> actions can also be given as indented code
at the beginning of the rules section. For example, the following
will cause the scanner to enter the "SPECIAL" start condition
whenever <code>yylex()</code> is called and the global variable
<code>enter_special</code> is true:

<pre><code>
            int enter_special;

    %x SPECIAL
    %%
            if ( enter_special )
                BEGIN(SPECIAL);

    &lt;SPECIAL&gt;blahblahblah
    ...more rules follow...
</code></pre>

<p>To illustrate the uses of start conditions, here is a scanner which
provides two different interpretations of a string like "123.456". By
default it will treat it as three tokens, the integer "123", a dot ('.'),
and the integer "456". But if the string is preceded earlier in the
line by the string "expect-floats" it will treat it as a single token,
the floating-point number 123.456:

<pre><code>
    %{
    #include &lt;math.h&gt;
    %}
    %s expect

    %%
    expect-floats        BEGIN(expect);

    &lt;expect&gt;[0-9]+&quot;.&quot;[0-9]+      {
                printf( &quot;found a float, = %f\n&quot;,
                        atof( yytext ) );
                }

<p>Here is a scanner which recognizes (and discards) C comments while
maintaining a count of the current input line.

<pre><code>
    %x comment
    %%
            int line_num = 1;

    &quot;/*&quot;         BEGIN(comment);

    &lt;comment&gt;[^*\n]*        /* eat anything that&#39;s not a &#39;*&#39; */
    &lt;comment&gt;&quot;*&quot;+[^*/\n]*   /* eat up &#39;*&#39;s not followed by &#39;/&#39;s */
    &lt;comment&gt;\n             ++line_num;
    &lt;comment&gt;&quot;*&quot;+&quot;/&quot;        BEGIN(INITIAL);
</code></pre>

<p>This scanner goes to a bit of trouble to match as much text as possible
with each rule. In general, when attempting to write a high-speed scanner
try to match as much possible in each rule, as it's a big win.

<p>Note that start-conditions names are really integer values and can
be stored as such. Thus, the above could be extended in the following
fashion:

<pre><code>
    %x comment foo
    %%
            int line_num = 1;
            int comment_caller;

    &quot;/*&quot;         {
                 comment_caller = INITIAL;
                 BEGIN(comment);
                 }

    ...

    &lt;foo&gt;&quot;/*&quot;    {
                 comment_caller = foo;
                 BEGIN(comment);
                 }

    &lt;comment&gt;[^*\n]*        /* eat anything that&#39;s not a &#39;*&#39; */
    &lt;comment&gt;&quot;*&quot;+[^*/\n]*   /* eat up &#39;*&#39;s not followed by &#39;/&#39;s */
    &lt;comment&gt;\n             ++line_num;
    &lt;comment&gt;&quot;*&quot;+&quot;/&quot;        BEGIN(comment_caller);
</code></pre>

<p>Furthermore, you can access the current start condition using the
integer-valued <code>YY_START</code> macro. For example, the above
assignments to <code>comment_caller</code> could instead be written

<pre><code>
    comment_caller = YY_START;
</code></pre>

<p>Flex provides <code>YYSTATE</code> as an alias for
<code>YY_START</code> (since that is what's used by AT&amp;T
<code>lex</code>).

<p>Note that start conditions do not have their own name-space; %s's
and %x's declare names in the same fashion as #define's.

<p>Finally, here's an example of how to match C-style quoted strings
using exclusive start conditions, including expanded escape sequences
(but not including checking for a string that's too long):

<pre><code>
    %x str

    %%
            char string_buf[MAX_STR_CONST];
            char *string_buf_ptr;


    \&quot;      string_buf_ptr = string_buf; BEGIN(str);

    &lt;str&gt;\&quot;        { /* saw closing quote - all done */
            BEGIN(INITIAL);
            *string_buf_ptr = &#39;\0&#39;;
            /* return string constant token type and
             * value to parser
             */
            }

    &lt;str&gt;\n        {
            /* error - unterminated string constant */
            /* generate error message */
            }

    &lt;str&gt;\\[0-7]{1,3} {
            /* octal escape sequence */
            int result;

            (void) sscanf( yytext + 1, &quot;%o&quot;, &amp;result );

            if ( result &gt; 0xff )
                    /* error, constant is out-of-bounds */

            *string_buf_ptr++ = result;
            }

    &lt;str&gt;\\[0-9]+ {
            /* generate error - bad escape sequence; something
             * like &#39;\48&#39; or &#39;\0777777&#39;
             */
            }

    &lt;str&gt;\\n  *string_buf_ptr++ = &#39;\n&#39;;
    &lt;str&gt;\\t  *string_buf_ptr++ = &#39;\t&#39;;
    &lt;str&gt;\\r  *string_buf_ptr++ = &#39;\r&#39;;
    &lt;str&gt;\\b  *string_buf_ptr++ = &#39;\b&#39;;
    &lt;str&gt;\\f  *string_buf_ptr++ = &#39;\f&#39;;

    &lt;str&gt;\\(.|\n)  *string_buf_ptr++ = yytext[1];

    &lt;str&gt;[^\\\n\&quot;]+        {
            char *yptr = yytext;

            while ( *yptr )
                    *string_buf_ptr++ = *yptr++;
            }
</code></pre>

<p>Often, such as in some of the examples above, you wind up writing a
whole bunch of rules all preceded by the same start condition(s). Flex
makes this a little easier and cleaner by introducing a notion of start
condition <em>scope</em>. A start condition scope is begun with:

<pre><code>
    &lt;SCs&gt;{
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>SCs</code> is a list of one or more start
conditions. Inside the start condition scope, every rule automatically has
the prefix <code>&lt;SCs&gt;</code> applied to it, until a <code>'}'</code>
which matches the initial <code>'{'</code>. So, for example,

<pre><code>
    &lt;ESC&gt;{
        &quot;\\n&quot;   return &#39;\n&#39;;
        &quot;\\r&quot;   return &#39;\r&#39;;
        &quot;\\f&quot;   return &#39;\f&#39;;
        &quot;\\0&quot;   return &#39;\0&#39;;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>is equivalent to:

<pre><code>
    &lt;ESC&gt;&quot;\\n&quot;  return &#39;\n&#39;;
    &lt;ESC&gt;&quot;\\r&quot;  return &#39;\r&#39;;
    &lt;ESC&gt;&quot;\\f&quot;  return &#39;\f&#39;;
    &lt;ESC&gt;&quot;\\0&quot;  return &#39;\0&#39;;
</code></pre>

<p>Start condition scopes may be nested.

<p>Three routines are available for manipulating stacks of start
conditions:

<dl>

<dt><code>void yy_push_state(int new_state)</code></dt>

<dd><p>pushes the current start condition onto the top of the start
    condition stack and switches to <code>new_state</code> as though you had
    used <code>BEGIN new_state</code> (recall that start condition names
    are also integers).
</dd>

<dt><code>void yy_pop_state()</code></dt>

<dd><p>pops the top of the stack and switches to it via <code>BEGIN</code>.
</dd>

<dt><code>int yy_top_state()</code></dt>

<dd><p>returns the top of the stack without altering the stack's contents.
</dd>

</dl>

<p>The start condition stack grows dynamically and so has no built-in
size limitation. If memory is exhausted, program execution aborts.

<p>To use start condition stacks, your scanner must include a
<code>%option stack</code> directive (see Options below).

<h1 id="multiple-input-buffers">MULTIPLE INPUT BUFFERS</h1>

<p>Some scanners (such as those which support "include" files) require
reading from several input streams. As <code>flex</code> scanners do a
large amount of buffering, one cannot control where the next input will
be read from by simply writing a <code>YY_INPUT</code> which is sensitive
to the scanning context. <code>YY_INPUT</code> is only called when the
scanner reaches the end of its buffer, which may be a long time after
scanning a statement such as an "include" which requires switching the
input source.

<p>To negotiate these sorts of problems, <code>flex</code> provides a
mechanism for creating and switching between multiple input buffers. An
input buffer is created by using:

<pre><code>
    YY_BUFFER_STATE yy_create_buffer( FILE *file, int size )
</code></pre>

<p>which takes a <code>FILE</code> pointer and a size and creates a buffer
associated with the given file and large enough to hold <code>size</code>
characters (when in doubt, use <code>YY_BUF_SIZE</code> for the size). It
returns a <code>YY_BUFFER_STATE</code> handle, which may then be
passed to other routines (see below). The <code>YY_BUFFER_STATE</code>
type is a pointer to an opaque <code>struct yy_buffer_state</code>
structure, so you may safely initialize YY_BUFFER_STATE variables to
<code>((YY_BUFFER_STATE) 0)</code> if you wish, and also refer to the
opaque structure in order to correctly declare input buffers in source
files other than that of your scanner. Note that the <code>FILE</code>
pointer in the call to <code>yy_create_buffer</code> is only used as
the value of <code>yyin</code> seen by <code>YY_INPUT;</code> if you
redefine <code>YY_INPUT</code> so it no longer uses <code>yyin</code>,
then you can safely pass a nil <code>FILE</code> pointer to
<code>yy_create_buffer</code>. You select a particular buffer to scan
from using:

<pre><code>
    void yy_switch_to_buffer( YY_BUFFER_STATE new_buffer )
</code></pre>

<p>switches the scanner's input buffer so subsequent tokens will come
from <code>new_buffer</code>. Note that <code>yy_switch_to_buffer()</code>
may be used by <code>yywrap()</code> to set things up for continued scanning, instead
of opening a new file and pointing <code>yyin</code> at it. Note also
that switching input sources via either <code>yy_switch_to_buffer()</code>
or <code>yywrap()</code> does <em>not</em> change the start condition.

<pre><code>
    void yy_delete_buffer( YY_BUFFER_STATE buffer )
</code></pre>

<p>is used to reclaim the storage associated with a buffer. (
<code>buffer</code> can be nil, in which case the routine does
nothing.) You can also clear the current contents of a buffer using:

<pre><code>
    void yy_flush_buffer( YY_BUFFER_STATE buffer )
</code></pre>

<p>This function discards the buffer's contents, so the next time the
scanner attempts to match a token from the buffer, it will first fill
the buffer anew using <code>YY_INPUT</code>.

<p><code>yy_new_buffer()</code> is an alias for
<code>yy_create_buffer()</code>, provided for compatibility with the
C++ use of <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code> for creating and destroying
dynamic objects.

<p>Finally, the <code>YY_CURRENT_BUFFER</code> macro returns a
<code>YY_BUFFER_STATE</code> handle to the current buffer.

<p>Here is an example of using these features for writing a scanner which
expands include files (the <code>&lt;&lt;EOF&gt;&gt;</code> feature is
discussed below):

<pre><code>
    /* the &quot;incl&quot; state is used for picking up the name
     * of an include file
     */
    %x incl

    %{
    #define MAX_INCLUDE_DEPTH 10
    YY_BUFFER_STATE include_stack[MAX_INCLUDE_DEPTH];
    int include_stack_ptr = 0;
    %}

    %%
    include             BEGIN(incl);

    [a-z]+              ECHO;
    [^a-z\n]*\n?        ECHO;

    &lt;incl&gt;[ \t]*      /* eat the whitespace */
    &lt;incl&gt;[^ \t\n]+   { /* got the include file name */
            if ( include_stack_ptr &gt;= MAX_INCLUDE_DEPTH )
                {
                fprintf( stderr, &quot;Includes nested too deeply&quot; );
                exit( 1 );
                }

            include_stack[include_stack_ptr++] =
                YY_CURRENT_BUFFER;

            yyin = fopen( yytext, &quot;r&quot; );

            if ( ! yyin )
                error( ... );

            yy_switch_to_buffer(
                yy_create_buffer( yyin, YY_BUF_SIZE ) );

            BEGIN(INITIAL);
            }

    &lt;&lt;EOF&gt;&gt; {
            if ( --include_stack_ptr &lt; 0 )
                {
                yyterminate();
                }

            else
                {
                yy_delete_buffer( YY_CURRENT_BUFFER );
                yy_switch_to_buffer(
                     include_stack[include_stack_ptr] );
                }
            }
</code></pre>

<p>Three routines are available for setting up input buffers for
scanning in-memory strings instead of files. All of them create a
new input buffer for scanning the string, and return a corresponding
<code>YY_BUFFER_STATE</code> handle (which you should delete with
<code>yy_delete_buffer()</code> when done with it). They also switch
to the new buffer using <code>yy_switch_to_buffer()</code>, so the next
call to <code>yylex()</code> will start scanning the string.

<dl>

<dt><code>yy_scan_string(const char *str)</code></dt>

<dd><p>scans a NUL-terminated string.
</dd>

<dt><code>yy_scan_bytes(const char *bytes, int len)</code></dt>

<dd><p>scans <code>len</code> bytes (including possibly NUL's) starting at
    location <code>bytes</code>.
</dd>

</dl>

<p>Note that both of these functions create and scan a <em>copy</em> of
the string or bytes. (This may be desirable, since <code>yylex()</code>
modifies the contents of the buffer it is scanning.) You can avoid the
copy by using:

<dl>

<dt><code>yy_scan_buffer(char *base, yy_size_t size)</code></dt>

<dd><p>which scans in place the buffer starting at <code>base</code>, consisting
    of <code>size</code> bytes, the last two bytes of which <em>must</em> be
    <code>YY_END_OF_BUFFER_CHAR</code> (ASCII NUL). These last two bytes
    are not scanned; thus, scanning consists of <code>base[0]</code> through
    <code>base[size-2]</code>, inclusive.

<p>If you fail to set up <code>base</code> in this manner (i.e.,
forget the final two <code>YY_END_OF_BUFFER_CHAR</code> bytes), then
<code>yy_scan_buffer()</code> returns a nil pointer instead of creating
a new input buffer.

<p>The type <code>yy_size_t</code> is an integral type to which you can
cast an integer expression reflecting the size of the buffer.
</dd>

</dl>

<h1 id="end-of-file-rules">END-OF-FILE RULES</h1>

<p>The special rule "&lt;&lt;EOF&gt;&gt;" indicates actions which are to
be taken when an end-of-file is encountered and <code>yywrap()</code> returns non-zero
(i.e., indicates no further files to process). The action must finish
by doing one of four things:

<ul>

<li><p>assigning <code>yyin</code>
    to a new input file (in previous versions of flex, after doing the
    assignment you had to call the special action
    <code>YY_NEW_FILE;</code> this is no longer necessary);

<li><p>executing a <code>return</code> statement;

<li><p>executing the special <code>yyterminate()</code> action;

<li><p>or, switching to a new buffer using <code>yy_switch_to_buffer()</code>
    as shown in the example above.

</ul>

<p>&lt;&lt;EOF&gt;&gt; rules may not be used with other patterns; they
may only be qualified with a list of start conditions. If an unqualified
&lt;&lt;EOF&gt;&gt; rule is given, it applies to <em>all</em> start
conditions which do not already have &lt;&lt;EOF&gt;&gt; actions. To
specify an &lt;&lt;EOF&gt;&gt; rule for only the initial start condition,
use

<pre><code>
    &lt;INITIAL&gt;&lt;&lt;EOF&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>These rules are useful for catching things like unclosed comments. An
example:

<pre><code>
    %x quote
    %%

    ...other rules for dealing with quotes...

    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;&lt;EOF&gt;&gt;   {
             error( &quot;unterminated quote&quot; );
             yyterminate();
             }
    &lt;&lt;EOF&gt;&gt;  {
             if ( *++filelist )
                 yyin = fopen( *filelist, &quot;r&quot; );
             else
                yyterminate();
             }
</code></pre>

<h1 id="miscellaneous-macros">MISCELLANEOUS MACROS</h1>

<p>The macro <code>YY_USER_ACTION</code> can be defined to provide an
action which is always executed prior to the matched rule's action. For
example, it could be #define'd to call a routine to convert yytext to
lower-case. When <code>YY_USER_ACTION</code> is invoked, the variable
<code>yy_act</code> gives the number of the matched rule (rules are numbered
starting with 1). Suppose you want to profile how often each of your
rules is matched. The following would do the trick:

<pre><code>
    #define YY_USER_ACTION ++ctr[yy_act]
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>ctr</code> is an array to hold the counts for the different
rules. Note that the macro <code>YY_NUM_RULES</code> gives the
total number of rules (including the default rule, even if you use
<code>-s</code>), so a correct declaration for <code>ctr</code> is:

<pre><code>
    int ctr[YY_NUM_RULES];
</code></pre>

<p>The macro <code>YY_USER_INIT</code> may be defined to provide an
action which is always executed before the first scan (and before the
scanner's internal initializations are done). For example, it could be
used to call a routine to read in a data table or open a logging file.

<p>The macro <code>yy_set_interactive(is_interactive)</code>
can be used to control whether the current buffer is considered
<em>interactive</em>. An interactive buffer is processed more
slowly, but must be used when the scanner's input source is indeed
interactive to avoid problems due to waiting to fill buffers (see the
discussion of the <code>-I</code> flag below). A non-zero value in
the macro invocation marks the buffer as interactive, a zero value as
non-interactive. Note that use of this macro overrides
<code>%option always-interactive</code> or <code>%option never-interactive</code>
(see <a href="#options">Options</a> below). <code>yy_set_interactive()</code> must be invoked
prior to beginning to scan the buffer that is (or is not) to be considered
interactive.

<p>The macro <code>yy_set_bol(at_bol)</code> can be used to control
whether the current buffer's scanning context for the next token match
is done as though at the beginning of a line. A non-zero macro argument
makes rules anchored with

<p>The macro <code>YY_AT_BOL()</code> returns true if the next token
scanned from the current buffer will have '^' rules active, false
otherwise.

<p>In the generated scanner, the actions are all gathered in one large
switch statement and separated using <code>YY_BREAK</code>, which may be
redefined. By default, it is simply a "break", to separate each rule's
action from the following rule's. Redefining <code>YY_BREAK</code>
allows, for example, C++ users to #define YY_BREAK to do nothing (while
being very careful that every rule ends with a "break" or a "return"!) to
avoid suffering from unreachable statement warnings where because a rule's
action ends with "return", the <code>YY_BREAK</code> is inaccessible.

<h1 id="values-available-to-the-user">VALUES AVAILABLE TO THE USER</h1>

<p>This section summarizes the various values available to the user in
the rule actions.

<ul>

<li><p><code>char *yytext</code> holds the text of the current token. It may
    be modified but not lengthened (you cannot append characters to the end).

    <p>If the special directive <code>%array</code> appears in the first
    section of the scanner description, then <code>yytext</code> is instead
    declared <code>char yytext[YYLMAX]</code>, where <code>YYLMAX</code>
    is a macro definition that you can redefine in the first section if you
    don't like the default value (generally 8KB). Using <code>%array</code>
    results in somewhat slower scanners, but the value of <code>yytext</code>
    becomes immune to calls to <code>input()</code> and <code>unput()</code>, which
    potentially destroy its value when <code>yytext</code> is a character
    pointer. The opposite of <code>%array</code> is <code>%pointer</code>,
    which is the default.

    <p>You cannot use <code>%array</code> when generating C++ scanner
    classes (the <code>-+</code> flag).

<li><p><code>int yyleng</code>
    holds the length of the current token.

<li><p><code>FILE *yyin</code>
    is the file which by default <code>flex</code> reads from. It may be
    redefined but doing so only makes sense before scanning begins or
    after an EOF has been encountered. Changing it in the midst of
    scanning will have unexpected results since <code>flex</code>
    buffers its input; use <code>yyrestart()</code> instead. Once
    scanning terminates because an end-of-file has been seen, you can
    assign <code>yyin</code> at the new input file and then call the
    scanner again to continue scanning.

<li><p><code>void yyrestart(FILE *new_file)</code>
    may be called to point <code>yyin</code> at the new input file. The
    switch-over to the new file is immediate (any previously buffered-up
    input is lost). Note that calling <code>yyrestart()</code> with
    <code>yyin</code> as an argument thus throws away the current input
    buffer and continues scanning the same input file.

<li><p><code>FILE *yyout</code>
    is the file to which <code>ECHO</code> actions are done. It can be
    reassigned by the user.

<li><p><code>YY_CURRENT_BUFFER</code>
    returns a <code>YY_BUFFER_STATE</code> handle to the current
    buffer.

<li><p><code>YY_START</code>
    returns an integer value corresponding to the current start
    condition. You can subsequently use this value with
    <code>BEGIN</code> to return to that start condition.

</ul>

<h1 id="interfacing-with-yacc">INTERFACING WITH YACC</h1>

<p>One of the main uses of <code>flex</code> is as a companion to
the <code>yacc</code> parser-generator. <code>yacc</code> parsers expect
to call a routine named <code>yylex()</code> to find the next
input token. The routine is supposed to return the type of the
next token as well as putting any associated value in the global
<code>yylval</code>. To use <code>flex</code> with <code>yacc</code>, one
specifies the <code>-d</code> option to <code>yacc</code> to instruct it to
generate the file <code>y.tab.h</code> containing definitions of all
the <code>%tokens</code> appearing in the <code>yacc</code> input. This
file is then included in the <code>flex</code> scanner. For example,
if one of the tokens is "TOK_NUMBER", part of the scanner might look like:

<pre><code>
    %{
    #include &quot;y.tab.h&quot;
    %}

    %%

    [0-9]+        yylval = atoi( yytext ); return TOK_NUMBER;
</code></pre>

<h1 id="options">OPTIONS</h1>

<p><code>flex</code> has the following options:

<dl>

<dt><code>-b</code></dt>

<dd><p>Generate backing-up information to <code>lex.backup</code>. This is a list
    of scanner states which require backing up and the input characters on
    which they do so. By adding rules one can remove backing-up states. If
    <em>all</em> backing-up states are eliminated and <code>-Cf</code>
    or <code>-CF</code> is used, the generated scanner will run faster
    (see the <code>-p</code> flag). Only users who wish to squeeze every
    last cycle out of their scanners need worry about this option. (See the
    section on Performance Considerations below.)
</dd>

<dt><code>-c</code></dt>

<dd><p>is a do-nothing, deprecated option included for POSIX compliance.
</dd>

<dt><code>-d</code></dt>

<dd><p>makes the generated scanner run in <em>debug</em> mode. Whenever
    a pattern is recognized and the global <code>yy_flex_debug</code> is
    non-zero (which is the default), the scanner will write to <code>stderr</code>
    a line of the form:

    <pre><code>
        --accepting rule at line 53 (&quot;the matched text&quot;)

    <p>The line number refers to the location of the rule in the file
    defining the scanner (i.e., the file that was fed to flex). Messages
    are also generated when the scanner backs up, accepts the default rule,
    reaches the end of its input buffer (or encounters a NUL; at this point,
    the two look the same as far as the scanner's concerned), or reaches
    an end-of-file.

<dt><code>-f</code></dt>

    is bypassed. The result is large but fast. This option is equivalent to
    <code>-Cfr</code> (see below).
</dd>

<dt><code>-h</code></dt>

<dd><p>generates a "help" summary of <code>flex</code>'s options to

    are synonyms for <code>-h</code>.
</dd>

<dt><code>-i</code></dt>

<dd><p>instructs <code>flex</code> to generate a <em>case-insensitive</em>
    scanner. The case of letters given in the <code>flex</code> input patterns
    will be ignored, and tokens in the input will be matched regardless
    of case. The matched text given in <code>yytext</code> will have the
    preserved case (i.e., it will not be folded).
</dd>

<dt><code>-l</code></dt>

<dd><p>turns on maximum compatibility with the original AT&amp;T
    <code>lex</code> implementation. Note that this does not mean
    <em>full</em> compatibility. Use of this option costs a considerable
    amount of performance, and it cannot be used with the <code>-+, -f,
    -F, -Cf</code>, or <code>-CF</code> options. For details on the
    compatibilities it provides, see the section "Incompatibilities
    With Lex And POSIX" below. This option also results in the name
    <code>YY_FLEX_LEX_COMPAT</code> being #define'd in the generated scanner.
</dd>

<dt><code>-n</code></dt>

<dd><p>is another do-nothing, deprecated option included only for POSIX
    compliance.
</dd>

<dt><code>-p</code></dt>

<dd><p>generates a performance report to stderr. The report consists of
    comments regarding features of the <code>flex</code> input file which
    will cause a serious loss of performance in the resulting scanner. If
    you give the flag twice, you will also get comments regarding features
    that lead to minor performance losses.

    <p>Note that the use of <code>REJECT</code>, <code>%option yylineno</code>,
    and variable trailing context (see the Deficiencies /
    Bugs section below) entails a substantial performance penalty; use of
    <code>yymore()</code>, the <code>^</code> operator, and the <code>-I</code>
    flag entail minor performance penalties.
</dd>

<dt><code>-s</code></dt>

<dd><p>causes the <em>default rule</em> (that unmatched scanner input is
    echoed to <code>stdout</code>) to be suppressed. If the scanner encounters
    input that does not match any of its rules, it aborts with an error. This
    option is useful for finding holes in a scanner's rule set.
</dd>

<dt><code>-t</code></dt>

<dd><p>instructs <code>flex</code> to write the scanner it generates to
    standard output instead of <code>lex.yy.c</code>.
</dd>

<dt><code>-v</code></dt>

<dd><p>specifies that <code>flex</code> should write to <code>stderr</code>
    a summary of statistics regarding the scanner it generates. Most of
    the statistics are meaningless to the casual <code>flex</code> user,
    but the first line identifies the version of <code>flex</code> (same
    as reported by <code>-V</code>), and the next line the flags used when
    generating the scanner, including those that are on by default.
</dd>

<dt><code>-w</code></dt>

<dd><p>suppresses warning messages.
</dd>

<dt><code>-B</code></dt>

<dd><p>instructs <code>flex</code> to generate a <em>batch</em> scanner, the
    opposite of <em>interactive</em> scanners generated by <code>-I</code>
    (see below). In general, you use <code>-B</code> when you are
    <em>certain</em> that your scanner will never be used interactively,
    and you want to squeeze a <em>little</em> more performance out of it. If
    your goal is instead to squeeze out a <em>lot</em> more performance,
    you should be using the <code>-Cf</code> or <code>-CF</code> options
    (discussed below), which turn on <code>-B</code> automatically anyway.
</dd>

<dt><code>-F</code></dt>

<dd><p>specifies that the fast scanner table representation should be used
    (and stdio bypassed). This representation is about as fast as the
    full table representation <code>(-f)</code>, and for some sets of
    patterns will be considerably smaller (and for others, larger). In
    general, if the pattern set contains both "keywords" and a
    catch-all, "identifier" rule, such as in the set:

    <pre><code>
        &quot;case&quot;    return TOK_CASE;
        &quot;switch&quot;  return TOK_SWITCH;
        ...
        &quot;default&quot; return TOK_DEFAULT;
        [a-z]+    return TOK_ID;
</code></pre>

    <p>then you're better off using the full table representation. If only
    the "identifier" rule is present and you then use a hash table or some
    such to detect the keywords, you're better off using <code>-F</code>.

    <p>This option is equivalent to <code>-CFr</code> (see below). It cannot
    be used with <code>-+</code>.

<dt><code>-I</code></dt>

<dd><p>instructs <code>flex</code> to generate an <em>interactive</em>
    scanner. An interactive scanner is one that only looks ahead to decide
    what token has been matched if it absolutely must. It turns out that
    always looking one extra character ahead, even if the scanner has already
    seen enough text to disambiguate the current token, is a bit faster than
    only looking ahead when necessary. But scanners that always look ahead
    give dreadful interactive performance; for example, when a user types
    a newline, it is not recognized as a newline token until they enter
    <em>another</em> token, which often means typing in another whole line.

    <p><code>flex</code> scanners default to <em>interactive</em> unless you
    use the <code>-Cf</code> or <code>-CF</code> table-compression options
    (see below). That's because if you're looking for high-performance
    you should be using one of these options, so if you didn't,
    <code>flex</code> assumes you'd rather trade off a bit of run-time
    performance for intuitive interactive behavior. Note also that you
    <em>cannot</em> use <code>-I</code> in conjunction with <code>-Cf</code>
    or <code>-CF</code>. Thus, this option is not really needed; it is on
    by default for all those cases in which it is allowed.

    <p>You can force a scanner to <em>not</em> be interactive by using
    <code>-B</code> (see above).
</dd>

<dt><code>-L</code></dt>

<dd><p>instructs <code>flex</code> not to generate <code>#line</code>
    directives. Without this option, <code>flex</code> peppers the generated
    scanner with #line directives so error messages in the actions will be
    correctly located with respect to either the original <code>flex</code>
    input file (if the errors are due to code in the input file), or
    <code>lex.yy.c</code> (if the errors are <code>flex</code>'s fault --
    you should report these sorts of errors to the email address given below).
</dd>

<dt><code>-T</code></dt>

<dd><p>makes <code>flex</code> run in <em>trace</em> mode. It will generate a
    lot of messages to <code>stderr</code> concerning the form of the input and
    the resultant non-deterministic and deterministic finite automata. This
    option is mostly for use in maintaining <code>flex</code>.
</dd>

<dt><code>-V</code></dt>

<dd><p>prints the version number to <code>stdout</code> and
    exits. <code>--version</code> is a synonym for <code>-V</code>.
</dd>

<dt><code>-7</code></dt>

<dd><p>instructs <code>flex</code> to generate a 7-bit scanner, i.e., one
    which can only recognized 7-bit characters in its input. The advantage of
    using <code>-7</code> is that the scanner's tables can be up to half the
    size of those generated using the <code>-8</code> option (see below). The
    disadvantage is that such scanners often hang or crash if their input
    contains an 8-bit character.

    <p>Note, however, that unless you generate your scanner using the
    <code>-Cf</code> or <code>-CF</code> table compression options, use of
    <code>-7</code> will save only a small amount of table space, and make
    your scanner considerably less portable. <code>flex</code>'s default behavior
    is to generate an 8-bit scanner unless you use the <code>-Cf</code> or
    <code>-CF</code>, in which case <code>flex</code> defaults to generating
    7-bit scanners unless your site was always configured to generate 8-bit
    scanners (as will often be the case with non-USA sites). You can tell
    whether flex generated a 7-bit or an 8-bit scanner by inspecting the
    flag summary in the <code>-v</code> output as described above.

    <p>Note that if you use <code>-Cfe</code> or <code>-CFe</code> (those
    table compression options, but also using equivalence classes as discussed
    see below), flex still defaults to generating an 8-bit scanner, since
    usually with these compression options full 8-bit tables are not much
    more expensive than 7-bit tables.
</dd>

<dt><code>-8</code></dt>

<dd><p>instructs <code>flex</code> to generate an 8-bit scanner, i.e.,
    one which can recognize 8-bit characters. This flag is only needed
    for scanners generated using <code>-Cf</code> or <code>-CF</code>,
    as otherwise flex defaults to generating an 8-bit scanner anyway.

    <p>See the discussion of <code>-7</code> above for flex's default behavior
    and the tradeoffs between 7-bit and 8-bit scanners.
</dd>

<dt><code>-+</code></dt>

<dd><p>specifies that you want flex to generate a C++ scanner class. See
    the section on Generating C++ Scanners below for details.
</dd>

<dt><code>-C[aefFmr]</code></dt>

<dd><p>controls the degree of table compression and, more generally,
    trade-offs between small scanners and fast scanners.

    <p><code>-Ca</code> ("align") instructs flex to trade off larger tables
    in the generated scanner for faster performance because the elements
    of the tables are better aligned for memory access and computation. On
    some RISC architectures, fetching and manipulating longwords is more
    efficient than with smaller-sized units such as shortwords. This option
    can double the size of the tables used by your scanner.

    <p><code>-Ce</code> directs <code>flex</code> to construct <em>equivalence
    classes</em>, i.e., sets of characters which have identical lexical
    properties (for example, if the only appearance of digits in the
    <code>flex</code> input is in the character class "[0-9]" then the
    digits '0', '1', ..., '9' will all be put in the same equivalence
    class). Equivalence classes usually give dramatic reductions in the final
    table/object file sizes (typically a factor of 2-5) and are pretty cheap
    performance-wise (one array look-up per character scanned).

    <p><code>-Cf</code> specifies that the <em>full</em> scanner tables
    should be generated - <code>flex</code> should not compress the tables
    by taking advantages of similar transition functions for different states.

    <p><code>-CF</code> specifies that the alternate fast scanner
    representation (described above under the <code>-F</code> flag) should
    be used. This option cannot be used with <code>-+</code>.

    <p><code>-Cm</code> directs <code>flex</code> to construct
    <em>meta-equivalence classes</em>, which are sets of equivalence classes
    (or characters, if equivalence classes are not being used) that are
    commonly used together. Meta-equivalence classes are often a big win
    when using compressed tables, but they have a moderate performance impact
    (one or two "if" tests and one array look-up per character scanned).

    <p><code>-Cr</code> causes the generated scanner to <em>bypass</em>
    use of the standard I/O library (stdio) for input. Instead of calling
    <code>fread()</code> or <code>getc()</code>, the scanner will use the
    <code>read()</code> system call, resulting in a performance gain which
    varies from system to system, but in general is probably negligible
    unless you are also using <code>-Cf</code> or <code>-CF</code>. Using
    <code>-Cr</code> can cause strange behavior if, for example, you read from
    <code>yyin</code> using stdio prior to calling the scanner (because the
    scanner will miss whatever text your previous reads left in the stdio
    input buffer).

    <p><code>-Cr</code> has no effect if you define <code>YY_INPUT</code>
    (see The Generated Scanner above).

    <p>A lone <code>-C</code> specifies that the scanner tables should be
    compressed but neither equivalence classes nor meta-equivalence classes
    should be used.

    <p>The options <code>-Cf</code> or <code>-CF</code> and <code>-Cm</code>
    do not make sense together - there is no opportunity for meta-equivalence
    classes if the table is not being compressed. Otherwise the options may
    be freely mixed, and are cumulative.

    <p>The default setting is <code>-Cem</code>, which specifies
    that <code>flex</code> should generate equivalence classes and
    meta-equivalence classes. This setting provides the highest degree of
    table compression. You can trade off faster-executing scanners at the
    cost of larger tables with the following generally being true:

    <pre><code>
        slowest &amp; smallest
              -Cem
              -Cm
              -Ce
              -C
              -C{f,F}e
              -C{f,F}
              -C{f,F}a
        fastest &amp; largest
</code></pre>

    <p>Note that scanners with the smallest tables are usually generated
    and compiled the quickest, so during development you will usually want
    to use the default, maximal compression.

    <p><code>-Cfe</code> is often a good compromise between speed and size
    for production scanners.
</dd>

<dt><code>-ooutput</code></dt>

<dd><p>directs flex to write the scanner to the file <code>output</code>
    instead of <code>lex.yy.c</code>. If you combine <code>-o</code> with the
    <code>-t</code> option, then the scanner is written to <code>stdout</code>
    but its <code>#line</code> directives (see the <code>\-L</code> option
    above) refer to the file <code>output</code>.
</dd>

<dt id="prefix-option"><code>-Pprefix</code></dt>

<dd><p>changes the default <code>yy</code> prefix used by <code>flex</code>
    for all globally-visible variable and function names to instead be
    <code>prefix</code>. For example, <code>-Pfoo</code> changes the name
    of <code>yytext</code> to <code>footext</code>. It also changes
    the name of the default output file from <code>lex.yy.c</code> to
    <code>lex.foo.c</code>. Here are all of the names affected:

    <pre><code>
        yy_create_buffer
        yy_delete_buffer
        yy_flex_debug
        yy_init_buffer
        yy_flush_buffer
        yy_load_buffer_state
        yy_switch_to_buffer
        yyin
        yyleng
        yylex
        yylineno
        yyout
        yyrestart
        yytext
        yywrap
</code></pre>

    <p>If you are using a C++ scanner, then only
    <code>yyFlexLexer</code> (the scanner class name) is affected.

    <p>Within your scanner itself,
    you can still refer to the global variables and functions using either
    version of their name; but externally, they have the modified name.

    <p>This option lets you easily link together multiple <code>flex</code>
    programs into the same executable.

</dd>

<dt><code>-Sskeleton_file</code></dt>

<dd><p>overrides the default skeleton file from which <code>flex</code>
    constructs its scanners. You'll never need this option unless you are
    doing <code>flex</code> maintenance or development.
</dd>

</dl>

<p><code>flex</code> also provides a mechanism for controlling
options within the scanner specification itself, rather than from
the flex command-line. This is done by including <code>%option</code>
directives in the first section of the scanner specification. You can
specify multiple options with a single <code>%option</code> directive,
and multiple directives in the first section of your flex input file.

<p>Most options are given simply as names, optionally preceded by the
word "no" (with no intervening whitespace) to negate their meaning. A
number are equivalent to flex flags or their negation:

<pre><code>
    7bit            -7 option
    8bit            -8 option

    backup          -b option
    batch           -B option
    c++             -+ option

    caseful or

    array           equivalent to &quot;%array&quot;
    pointer         equivalent to &quot;%pointer&quot; (default)
</code></pre>

<p>Some <code>%option</code>s provide features otherwise not available:

<dl>

<dt><code>always-interactive</code></dt>

<dd><p>instructs flex to generate a scanner which always considers its
    input "interactive". Normally, on each new input file the scanner calls
    <code>isatty()</code> in an attempt to determine whether the scanner's
    input source is interactive and thus should be read a character at a
    time. When this option is used, however, then no such call is made.
</dd>

<dt><code>main</code></dt>

<dd><p>directs flex to provide a default <code>main()</code> program for the
    scanner.  Its definition is:

    <pre><code>
      int main()
      {
        /* Keep retrieving tokens and discarding them until EOF. */
        while (yylex() != 0)
          {} /* nothing */
        return 0;
      }
</code></pre>

    <p>smcpeak 2021-04-30: In flex-2.5.4, the <code>main()</code>
    function generated this way called <code>yylex()</code> just once.
    I do not see how that could ever have been useful.  I have changed
    it to be what the old <code>libfl.a</code> contained.  This way
    I can eliminate <code>libfl.a</code> without losing functionality.

    <p>smcpeak 2021-04-30: In flex-2.5.4, <code>%option main</code>
    implied <code>%option noyywrap</code>.  These two features are
    orthogonal, so I have removed that implication.
</dd>

<dt><code>never-interactive</code></dt>

<dd><p>instructs flex to generate a scanner which never considers its input
    "interactive" (again, no call made to <code>isatty()</code>). This is
    the opposite of <code>always-interactive</code>.
</dd>

<dt><code>stack</code></dt>

<dd><p>enables the use of start condition stacks
    (see <a href="#start-conditions">Start Conditions</a>).
</dd>

<dt><code>stdinit</code></dt>

<dd><p>if set (i.e., <code>%option stdinit</code>) initializes
    <code>yyin</code> and <code>yyout</code> to <code>stdin</code> and
    <code>stdout</code>, instead of the default of <code>nil</code>. Some existing
    <code>lex</code> programs depend on this behavior, even though it is
    not compliant with ANSI C, which does not require <code>stdin</code> and
    <code>stdout</code> to be compile-time constant.
</dd>

<dt><code>yylineno</code></dt>

<dd><p>directs <code>flex</code> to generate a scanner that maintains
    the number of the current line read from its input in the global
    variable <code>yylineno</code>. This option is implied by <code>%option
    lex-compat</code>.
</dd>

<dt id="option-yywrap"><code>yywrap</code></dt>

<dd><p>if set (i.e., <code>%option yywrap</code>), makes the scanner
    call <code>yywrap()</code> upon an end-of-file.  If unset
    (i.e., <code>%option noyywrap</code>), then the scanner behaves
    as though <code>yywrap()</code> always returns 1 (meaning no more
    files).  The default is <strong>unset</strong>.

    <p>If set, you must provide a definition of the
    <code>int yywrap(void)</code> function (either in your scanner
    definition, or in another file that it links with).  In that case,
    when the scanner reaches the end of one file, it calls
    <code>yywrap()</code>.  If <code>yywrap()</code> returns false
    (zero), then it is assumed that the function has set
    <code>yyin</code> to point to another input file, and scanning
    continues.  If it returns true (non-zero), then the scanner
    terminates, returning 0 to its caller.

    <p>When using <code>%option c++</code>, <code>yywrap()</code> is
    a method of the <code>yyFlexLexer</code> class.

    <p>smcpeak 2021-04-30: In flex-2.5.4, the default behavior was to
    enable <code>yywrap()</code>.  I have inverted that.

    <p>Rationale: Most users do not want <code>yywrap()</code>.  Those
    that do can easiily set the option asking for it.  That does
    introduce a backward compatibility issue; oh well.  My main goal
    is to remove <code>libfl.a</code> entirely for better portability,
    and for that, the default has to change.

</dd>

</dl>

<p><code>flex</code> scans your rule actions to determine whether you
use the <code>REJECT</code> or <code>yymore()</code> features. The
<code>reject</code> and <code>yymore</code> options are available
to override its decision as to whether you use the options, either by
setting them (e.g., <code>%option reject</code>) to indicate the feature
is indeed used, or unsetting them to indicate it actually is not used
(e.g., <code>%option noyymore</code>).

<p>Three options take string-delimited values, offset with '=':

<pre><code>
    %option outfile=&quot;ABC&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>is equivalent to <code>-oABC</code>, and

<pre><code>
    %option prefix=&quot;XYZ&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>is equivalent to <code>-PXYZ</code>. Finally,

<pre><code>
    %option yyclass=&quot;foo&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>only applies when generating a C++ scanner ( <code>-+</code>
option). It informs <code>flex</code> that you have derived
<code>foo</code> as a subclass of <code>yyFlexLexer</code>, so
<code>flex</code> will place your actions in the member function
<code>foo::yylex()</code> instead of <code>yyFlexLexer::yylex()</code>. It
also generates a <code>yyFlexLexer::yylex()</code>
member function that emits a run-time error (by invoking
<code>yyFlexLexer::LexerError()</code>) if called. See Generating C++
Scanners, below, for additional information.

<p>A number of options are available for lint purists who want to suppress
the appearance of unneeded routines in the generated scanner. Each of
the following, if unset (e.g., <code>%option nounput</code> ), results
in the corresponding routine not appearing in the generated scanner:

<pre><code>
    input, unput
    yy_push_state, yy_pop_state, yy_top_state
    yy_scan_buffer, yy_scan_bytes, yy_scan_string
</code></pre>

<p>(though <code>yy_push_state()</code> and friends won't appear anyway
unless you use <code>%option stack</code>).

<h1 id="performance-considerations">PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS</h1>

<p>The main design goal of <code>flex</code> is that it generate
high-performance scanners. It has been optimized for dealing well with
large sets of rules. Aside from the effects on scanner speed of the
table compression <code>-C</code> options outlined above, there are a
number of options/actions which degrade performance. These are, from
most expensive to least:

<pre><code>
    REJECT
    %option yylineno
    arbitrary trailing context

    pattern sets that require backing up
    %array
    %option interactive
    %option always-interactive

    &#39;^&#39; beginning-of-line operator
    yymore()
</code></pre>

<p>with the first three all being quite expensive and the last two
being quite cheap. Note also that <code>unput()</code> is implemented
as a routine call that potentially does quite a bit of work, while
<code>yyless()</code> is a quite-cheap macro; so if just putting back
some excess text you scanned, use <code>yyless()</code>.

<p><code>REJECT</code> should be avoided at all costs when performance
is important. It is a particularly expensive option.

<p>Getting rid of backing up is messy and often may be an enormous amount
of work for a complicated scanner. In principal, one begins by using the
<code>-b</code> flag to generate a <code>lex.backup</code> file. For example,
on the input

<pre><code>
    %%
    foo        return TOK_KEYWORD;
    foobar     return TOK_KEYWORD;
</code></pre>

<p>the file looks like:

<pre><code>
    State #6 is non-accepting -
     associated rule line numbers:
           2       3
     out-transitions: [ o ]
     jam-transitions: EOF [ \001-n  p-\177 ]

    State #8 is non-accepting -
     associated rule line numbers:
           3
     out-transitions: [ a ]
     jam-transitions: EOF [ \001-`  b-\177 ]

    State #9 is non-accepting -
     associated rule line numbers:
           3
     out-transitions: [ r ]
     jam-transitions: EOF [ \001-q  s-\177 ]

    Compressed tables always back up.
</code></pre>

<p>The first few lines tell us that there's a scanner state in which
it can make a transition on an 'o' but not on any other character,
and that in that state the currently scanned text does not match any
rule. The state occurs when trying to match the rules found at lines 2
and 3 in the input file. If the scanner is in that state and then reads
something other than an 'o', it will have to back up to find a rule
which is matched. With a bit of headscratching one can see that this
must be the state it's in when it has seen "fo". When this has happened,
if anything other than another 'o' is seen, the scanner will have to
back up to simply match the 'f' (by the default rule).

<p>The comment regarding State #8 indicates there's a problem when "foob"
has been scanned. Indeed, on any character other than an 'a', the scanner
will have to back up to accept "foo". Similarly, the comment for State
#9 concerns when "fooba" has been scanned and an 'r' does not follow.

<p>The final comment reminds us that there's no point going to all
the trouble of removing backing up from the rules unless we're using
<code>-Cf</code> or <code>-CF</code>, since there's no performance gain
doing so with compressed scanners.

<p>The way to remove the backing up is to add "error" rules:

<pre><code>
    %%
    foo         return TOK_KEYWORD;
    foobar      return TOK_KEYWORD;

    fooba       |
    foob        |
    fo          {
                /* false alarm, not really a keyword */
                return TOK_ID;
                }
</code></pre>

<p>Eliminating backing up among a list of keywords can also be done
using a "catch-all" rule:

<pre><code>
    %%
    foo         return TOK_KEYWORD;
    foobar      return TOK_KEYWORD;

    [a-z]+      return TOK_ID;
</code></pre>

<p>This is usually the best solution when appropriate.

<p>Backing up messages tend to cascade. With a complicated set of rules
it's not uncommon to get hundreds of messages. If one can decipher
them, though, it often only takes a dozen or so rules to eliminate the
backing up (though it's easy to make a mistake and have an error rule
accidentally match a valid token. A possible future <code>flex</code>
feature will be to automatically add rules to eliminate backing up).

<p>It's important to keep in mind that you gain the benefits of
eliminating backing up only if you eliminate <em>every</em> instance of
backing up. Leaving just one means you gain nothing.

<p><em>Variable</em> trailing context (where both the leading and trailing
parts do not have a fixed length) entails almost the same performance loss
as <code>REJECT</code> (i.e., substantial). So when possible a rule like:

<pre><code>
    %%
    mouse|rat/(cat|dog)   run();
</code></pre>

<p>is better written:

<pre><code>
    %%
    mouse/cat|dog         run();
    rat/cat|dog           run();
</code></pre>

<p>or as

<pre><code>
    %%
    mouse|rat/cat         run();
    mouse|rat/dog         run();
</code></pre>

<p>Note that here the special '|' action does <em>not</em> provide any
savings, and can even make things worse (see Deficiencies / Bugs below).

<p>Another area where the user can increase a scanner's performance (and
one that's easier to implement) arises from the fact that the longer the
tokens matched, the faster the scanner will run. This is because with long
tokens the processing of most input characters takes place in the (short)
inner scanning loop, and does not often have to go through the additional
work of setting up the scanning environment (e.g., <code>yytext</code>)
for the action. Recall the scanner for C comments:

<pre><code>
    %x comment
    %%
            int line_num = 1;

    &quot;/*&quot;         BEGIN(comment);

    &lt;comment&gt;[^*\n]*
    &lt;comment&gt;&quot;*&quot;+[^*/\n]*
    &lt;comment&gt;\n             ++line_num;
    &lt;comment&gt;&quot;*&quot;+&quot;/&quot;        BEGIN(INITIAL);
</code></pre>

<p>This could be sped up by writing it as:

<pre><code>
    %x comment
    %%
            int line_num = 1;

    &quot;/*&quot;         BEGIN(comment);

    &lt;comment&gt;[^*\n]*
    &lt;comment&gt;[^*\n]*\n      ++line_num;
    &lt;comment&gt;&quot;*&quot;+[^*/\n]*
    &lt;comment&gt;&quot;*&quot;+[^*/\n]*\n ++line_num;
    &lt;comment&gt;&quot;*&quot;+&quot;/&quot;        BEGIN(INITIAL);
</code></pre>

<p>Now instead of each newline requiring the processing of another action,
recognizing the newlines is "distributed" over the other rules to keep
the matched text as long as possible. Note that <em>adding</em> rules
does <em>not</em> slow down the scanner! The speed of the scanner is
independent of the number of rules or (modulo the considerations given
at the beginning of this section) how complicated the rules are with
regard to operators such as '*' and '|'.

<p>A final example in speeding up a scanner: suppose you want to scan
through a file containing identifiers and keywords, one per line and
with no other extraneous characters, and recognize all the keywords. A
natural first approach is:

<pre><code>
    %%
    asm      |
    auto     |
    break    |
    ... etc ...
    volatile |
    while    /* it&#39;s a keyword */

    .|\n     /* it&#39;s not a keyword */
</code></pre>

<p>To eliminate the back-tracking, introduce a catch-all rule:

<pre><code>
    %%
    asm      |
    auto     |
    break    |
    ... etc ...
    volatile |
    while    /* it&#39;s a keyword */

    [a-z]+   |
    .|\n     /* it&#39;s not a keyword */
</code></pre>

<p>Now, if it's guaranteed that there's exactly one word per line, then
we can reduce the total number of matches by a half by merging in the
recognition of newlines with that of the other tokens:

<pre><code>
    %%
    asm\n    |
    auto\n   |
    break\n  |
    ... etc ...
    volatile\n |
    while\n  /* it&#39;s a keyword */

    [a-z]+\n |
    .|\n     /* it&#39;s not a keyword */
</code></pre>

<p>One has to be careful here, as we have now reintroduced backing up into
the scanner. In particular, while <em>we</em> know that there will never
be any characters in the input stream other than letters or newlines,
<code>flex</code> can't figure this out, and it will plan for possibly
needing to back up when it has scanned a token like "auto" and then the
next character is something other than a newline or a letter. Previously
it would then just match the "auto" rule and be done, but now it has no
"auto" rule, only a "auto\n" rule. To eliminate the possibility of backing
up, we could either duplicate all rules but without final newlines, or,
since we never expect to encounter such an input and therefore don't
how it's classified, we can introduce one more catch-all rule, this one
which doesn't include a newline:

<pre><code>
    %%
    asm\n    |
    auto\n   |
    break\n  |
    ... etc ...
    volatile\n |
    while\n  /* it&#39;s a keyword */

    [a-z]+\n |
    [a-z]+   |
    .|\n     /* it&#39;s not a keyword */
</code></pre>

<p>Compiled with <code>-Cf</code>, this is about as fast as one can get
a <code>flex</code> scanner to go for this particular problem.

<p>A final note: <code>flex</code> is slow when matching NUL's,
particularly when a token contains multiple NUL's. It's best to write
rules which match <em>short</em> amounts of text if it's anticipated
that the text will often include NUL's.

<p>Another final note regarding performance: as mentioned above in the
section How the Input is Matched, dynamically resizing <code>yytext</code>
to accommodate huge tokens is a slow process because it presently
requires that the (huge) token be rescanned from the beginning. Thus if
performance is vital, you should attempt to match "large" quantities of
text but not "huge" quantities, where the cutoff between the two is at
about 8K characters/token.


<!-- ======================================================= -->
<h1 id="generating-cpp-scanners">GENERATING C++ SCANNERS</h1>

<p><code>flex</code> provides two different ways to generate scanners
for use with C++. The first way is to simply compile a C-interface scanner generated
by <code>flex</code> using a C++ compiler instead of a C compiler. You
should not encounter any compilations errors (please report any you
find to the email address given in the Author section below). You can
then use C++ code in your rule actions instead of C code. Note that
the default input source for your scanner remains <code>yyin</code>,
and default echoing is still done to <code>yyout</code>. Both of these
remain <code>FILE *</code> variables and not C++ <code>iostream</code>s.

<p>Alternatively, you can use <code>flex</code> to generate a C++-interface scanner class,
using the <code>-+</code> option (or, equivalently, <code>%option c++</code>).
When using this option,
flex defaults to generating the scanner to the file <code>lex.yy.cc</code>
instead of <code>lex.yy.c</code>. The generated scanner includes the
header file <code>FlexLexer.h</code>, which defines the interface to
the C++ scanner class.

<p>The scanner class, called <code>yyFlexLexer</code> by default
(overridden with the <a href="#prefix-option"><code>-P</code></a> option),
encapsulates the scanner state.

<p>The following methods manage the process of running the scanner over
input:

<dl>

<dt><code>yyFlexLexer(istream *arg_yyin = NULL, ostream *arg_yyout = NULL)</code></dt>

<dd><p>constructs a <code>yyFlexLexer</code> object using the given
    streams for input and output. If not specified, the streams default to
    <code>cin</code> and <code>cout</code>, respectively.
</dd>

<dt><code>int yylex()</code></dt>

<dd><p>performs the same role is <code>yylex()</code> does for ordinary flex
    scanners: it scans the input stream, consuming tokens, until a rule's
    action returns a value. If you derive a subclass <code>S</code> from
    <code>yyFlexLexer</code> and want to access the member functions and
    variables of <code>S</code> inside <code>yylex()</code>, then you need
    to use <code>%option yyclass="S"</code> to inform <code>flex</code> that
    you will be using that subclass instead of <code>yyFlexLexer</code>. In
    this case, rather than generating <code>yyFlexLexer::yylex()</code>,
    <code>flex</code> generates <code>S::yylex()</code> (and also
    generates a dummy <code>yyFlexLexer::yylex()</code> that calls
    <code>yyFlexLexer::LexerError()</code> if called).
</dd>

<dt><code>void switch_streams(istream *new_in = NULL, ostream *new_out = NULL)</code></dt>

<dd><p>reassigns <code>yyin</code> to <code>new_in</code> (if not NULL)
    and <code>yyout</code> to <code>new_out</code> (ditto), deleting the
    previous input buffer if <code>yyin</code> is reassigned.
</dd>

<dt><code>virtual int yywrap()</code></dt>

<dd><p>If <a href="#option-yywrap"><code>%option yywrap</code></a>
    is specified, then this will be invoked before <code>yylex()</code>
    returns EOF.  If not using <code>%option yyclass</code>, then
    define this as a method of <code>yyFlexLexer</code>, using the
    existing declaration in <code>FlexLexer.h</code>.  Otherwise,
    declare and define it as a method of your derived class.

<dt><code>yy_switch_to_buffer()</code>,
    <code>yy_create_buffer()</code>,
    <code>yy_flush_buffer()</code>,
    <code>yy_delete_buffer()</code>, and <code>yyrestart()</code>

<dd><p>These work like their C-interface counterparts except that the
    data sources and sinks are <code>i/ostream</code> pointers rather
    than <code>FILE*</code>.

</dl>

<p>When <code>yylex()</code> returns a non-zero value, these methods
can be used to inspect the token:

<dl>

<dt><code>const char *YYText()</code></dt>

<dd><p>returns the text of the most recently matched token, the equivalent
    of <code>yytext</code>.
</dd>

<dt><code>int YYLeng()</code></dt>

<dd><p>returns the length of the most recently matched token, the equivalent
    of <code>yyleng</code>.
</dd>

<dt><code>int lineno() const</code></dt>

<dd><p>returns the current input line number
    (see <code>%option yylineno</code>), or <code>1</code> if
    <code>%option yylineno</code> was not used.
</dd>

</dl>

<p>These methods support scanner debugging:

<dl>

<dt><code>void set_debug(int flag)</code></dt>

<dd><p>sets the debugging flag for the scanner, equivalent to assigning to
    <code>yy_flex_debug</code> (see the Options section above). Note that
    you must build the scanner using <code>%option debug</code> to include
    debugging information in it.
</dd>

<dt><code>int debug() const</code></dt>

<dd><p>returns the current setting of the debugging flag.
</dd>

</dl>

<p>In addition, <code>yyFlexLexer</code> defines the following protected
virtual functions which you can redefine in derived classes to adjust
how the scanner gets access to its input.  By overriding these,
<code>yyin</code> and <code>yyout</code> can be bypassed entirely:

<dl>

<dt><code>virtual int LexerInput(char *buf, int max_size)</code></dt>

<dd><p>reads up to <code>max_size</code> characters into <code>buf</code> and
    returns the number of characters read. To indicate end-of-input, return 0
    characters. Note that "interactive" scanners (see the <code>-B</code> and
    <code>-I</code> flags) define the macro <code>YY_INTERACTIVE</code>. If
    you redefine <code>LexerInput()</code> and need to take different
    actions depending on whether or not the scanner might be scanning an
    interactive input source, you can test for the presence of this name
    via <code>#ifdef</code>.
</dd>

<dt><code>virtual void LexerOutput(const char *buf, int size)</code></dt>

<dd><p>writes out <code>size</code> characters from the buffer
    <code>buf</code>, which, while NUL-terminated, may also contain "internal"
    NUL's if the scanner's rules can match text with NUL's in them.
</dd>

<dt><code>virtual void LexerError(const char *msg)</code></dt>

<dd><p>reports a fatal error message. The default version of this function
    writes the message to the stream <code>cerr</code> and exits.
</dd>

</dl>

<p>Note that a <code>yyFlexLexer</code> object contains its
<em>entire</em> scanning state. Thus you can use such objects to create
reentrant scanners. You can instantiate multiple instances of the same
<code>yyFlexLexer</code> class, and you can also combine multiple C++
scanner classes together in the same program using the <code>-P</code>
option discussed above.

<p>Finally, note that the <code>%array</code> feature is not available
to C++ scanner classes; you must use <code>%pointer</code> (the default).

<p>Here is an example of a simple C++ scanner:

<pre><code>
        // An example of using the flex C++ scanner class.

    %{
    int mylineno = 0;
    %}

    string  \&quot;[^\n&quot;]+\&quot;

    ws      [ \t]+

    alpha   [A-Za-z]
    dig     [0-9]
    name    ({alpha}|{dig}|\$)({alpha}|{dig}|[_.\-/$])*
    num1    [-+]?{dig}+\.?([eE][-+]?{dig}+)?
    num2    [-+]?{dig}*\.{dig}+([eE][-+]?{dig}+)?
    number  {num1}|{num2}

    %%

    {ws}    /* skip blanks and tabs */

    &quot;/*&quot;    {
            int c;

            while((c = yyinput()) != 0)
                {
                if(c == &#39;\n&#39;)
                    ++mylineno;

                else if(c == &#39;*&#39;)
                    {
                    if((c = yyinput()) == &#39;/&#39;)
                        break;
                    else
                        unput(c);
                    }
                }
            }

    {number}  cout &lt;&lt; &quot;number &quot; &lt;&lt; YYText() &lt;&lt; &#39;\n&#39;;

    \n        mylineno++;

    {name}    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;name &quot; &lt;&lt; YYText() &lt;&lt; &#39;\n&#39;;

    {string}  cout &lt;&lt; &quot;string &quot; &lt;&lt; YYText() &lt;&lt; &#39;\n&#39;;

    %%

    int main()
    {
        // Instantiate the scanner, which by default reads from cin (stdin).
        FlexLexer lexer;

        // Read tokens until EOF, doing only what the scanner actions do.
        while (lexer.yylex() != 0)
            {}

        return 0;
    }</code></pre>

<p>If you want to create multiple (different) lexer classes, you use
the <code>-P</code> flag (or the <code>prefix=</code> option) to rename
each <code>yyFlexLexer</code> to some other <code>xxFlexLexer</code>. You
then can include <code>&lt;FlexLexer.h&gt;</code> in your other sources
once per lexer class, first renaming <code>yyFlexLexer</code> as follows:

<pre><code>
    #undef yyFlexLexer
    #define yyFlexLexer xxFlexLexer
    #include &lt;FlexLexer.h&gt;

    #undef yyFlexLexer
    #define yyFlexLexer zzFlexLexer
    #include &lt;FlexLexer.h&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>if, for example, you used <code>%option prefix="xx"</code> for one
of your scanners and <code>%option prefix="zz"</code> for the other.

<p>smcpeak 2021-04-30: I have made several changes to the C++ interface
compared to flex-2.5.4:

<ul>

<li><p>The separate <code>FlexLexer</code> abstract base class is gone.
    It was not very useful (since a client would have no way of knowing
    what the token codes meant), and interferes with being able to easily
    combine multiple scanners in one program (since the cleanest way to
    do that would be to emit <em>two</em> headers, which is undesirable).

<li><p>Previously it was possible to select C++ mode by invoking
    <code>flex</code> as <code>flex++</code>; that has been removed.  (I
    dislike the idea that a program's behavior depends on its name.)

<li><p>The <code>int yylex(istream *new_in, ostream *new_out = 0)</code>
    method is gone.  The replacement for <code>yylex(i,o)</code> is
    <code>switch_streams(i,o)</code> then <code>yylex()</code>.

</ul>

<h1 id="incompatibilities-with-lex-and-posix">INCOMPATIBILITIES WITH LEX AND POSIX</h1>

<p><code>flex</code> is a rewrite of the AT&amp;T Unix <code>lex</code>
tool (the two implementations do not share any code, though), with some
extensions and incompatibilities, both of which are of concern to those
who wish to write scanners acceptable to either implementation. Flex
is fully compliant with the POSIX <code>lex</code> specification,
except that when using <code>%pointer</code> (the default), a call
to <code>unput()</code> destroys the contents of <code>yytext</code>,
which is counter to the POSIX specification.

<p>In this section we discuss all of the known areas of incompatibility
between flex, AT&amp;T lex, and the POSIX specification.

<p><code>flex</code>'s <code>-l</code> option turns on maximum
compatibility with the original AT&amp;T <code>lex</code> implementation,
at the cost of a major loss in the generated scanner's performance. We
note below which incompatibilities can be overcome using the
<code>-l</code> option.

<p><code>flex</code> is fully compatible with <code>lex</code> with the
following exceptions:

<ul>

<li><p>The undocumented <code>lex</code> scanner internal variable
    <code>yylineno</code> is not supported unless <code>-l</code> or
    <code>%option yylineno</code> is used.

<p><code>yylineno</code> should be maintained on a per-buffer basis,
rather than a per-scanner (single global variable) basis.

<p><code>yylineno</code> is not part of the POSIX specification.

<li><p>The <code>input()</code> routine is not redefinable, though it may
    be called to read characters following whatever has been matched by
    a rule. If <code>input()</code> encounters an end-of-file the normal
    <code>yywrap()</code> processing is done. A ``real'' end-of-file is
    returned by <code>input()</code> as <code>EOF</code>.

    <p>Input is instead controlled by defining the <code>YY_INPUT</code>
    macro.

    <p>The <code>flex</code> restriction that <code>input()</code> cannot
    be redefined is in accordance with the POSIX specification, which simply
    does not specify any way of controlling the scanner's input other than
    by making an initial assignment to <code>yyin</code>.

<li><p>The <code>unput()</code> routine is not redefinable. This restriction is
    in accordance with POSIX.

<li><p><code>flex</code> scanners are not as reentrant as <code>lex</code>
    scanners. In
    particular, if you have an interactive scanner and an interrupt
    handler which long-jumps out of the scanner, and the scanner is
    subsequently called again, you may get the following
    message:

    <pre><code>
        fatal flex scanner internal error--end of buffer missed
</code></pre>

    <p>To reenter the scanner, first use

    <pre><code>
        yyrestart( yyin );
</code></pre>

    <p>Note that this call will throw away any buffered input; usually this
    isn't a problem with an interactive scanner.

    <p>Also note that flex C++ scanner classes <em>are</em> reentrant,
    so if using C++ is an option for you, you should use them instead. See
    "Generating C++ Scanners" above for details.

<li><p><code>output()</code> is not supported. Output from the
    <code>ECHO</code> macro is done to the file-pointer <code>yyout</code>
    (default <code>stdout</code>).

<p><code>output()</code> is not part of the POSIX specification.

<li><p><code>lex</code>
    does not support exclusive start conditions (%x), though they are in
    the POSIX specification.

<li><p>When definitions are expanded, <code>flex</code> encloses them in
    parentheses. With lex, the following:

    <pre><code>
        NAME    [A-Z][A-Z0-9]*
        %%
        foo{NAME}?      printf( &quot;Found it\n&quot; );
        %%
</code></pre>

    <p>will not match the string "foo" because when the macro is expanded the
    rule is equivalent to "foo[A-Z][A-Z0-9]*?" and the precedence is such
    that the '?' is associated with "[A-Z0-9]*". With <code>flex</code>,
    the rule will be expanded to "foo([A-Z][A-Z0-9]*)?" and so the string
    "foo" will match.

    <p>Note that if the definition begins with <code>^</code> or ends with
    <code>$</code> then it is <em>not</em> expanded with parentheses, to
    allow these operators to appear in definitions without losing their
    special meanings. But the <code>&lt;s&gt;</code>, <code>/</code>,
    and <code>&lt;&lt;EOF&gt;&gt;</code> operators cannot be used in a
    <code>flex</code> definition.

    <p>Using <code>-l</code> results in the <code>lex</code> behavior of no
    parentheses around the definition.

    <p>The POSIX specification is that the definition be enclosed in
    parentheses.

<li><p>
    Some implementations of <code>lex</code> allow a rule's action to
    begin on a separate line, if the rule's pattern has trailing
    whitespace:

    <pre><code>
        %%
        foo|bar&lt;space here&gt;
          { foobar_action(); }
</code></pre>

    <p><code>flex</code> does not support this feature.

<li><p>
    The <code>lex</code> <code>%r</code> (generate a Ratfor scanner)
    option is not supported. It is not part of the POSIX
    specification.

<li><p>
    After a call to <code>unput()</code>, <code>yytext</code> is
    undefined until the next token is matched, unless the scanner was
    built using <code>%array</code>. This is not the case with
    <code>lex</code> or the POSIX specification. The <code>-l</code>
    option does away with this incompatibility.

<li><p>
    The precedence of the <code>{}</code> (numeric range) operator is
    different. <code>lex</code> interprets "abc{1,3}" as "match one,
    two, or three occurrences of 'abc'", whereas <code>flex</code>
    interprets it as "match 'ab' followed by one, two, or three
    occurrences of 'c'". The latter is in agreement with the POSIX
    specification.

<li><p>
    The precedence of the <code>^</code> operator is different.
    <code>lex</code> interprets "^foo|bar" as "match either 'foo' at the
    beginning of a line, or 'bar' anywhere", whereas <code>flex</code>
    interprets it as "match either 'foo' or 'bar' if they come at the
    beginning of a line". The latter is in agreement with the POSIX
    specification.

<li><p>
    The special table-size declarations such as <code>%a</code>
    supported by <code>lex</code> are not required by <code>flex</code>
    scanners; <code>flex</code> ignores them.

<li><p>
    The name <code>FLEX_SCANNER</code> is #define'd so scanners may be
    written for use with either <code>flex</code> or <code>lex</code>.
    Scanners also include <code>YY_FLEX_MAJOR_VERSION</code> and
    <code>YY_FLEX_MINOR_VERSION</code> indicating which version of
    <code>flex</code> generated the scanner (for example, for the 2.5
    release, these defines would be 2 and 5 respectively).

</ul>

<p>The following <code>flex</code> features are not included in
<code>lex</code> or the POSIX specification:

<pre><code>
    C++ scanners
    %option
    start condition scopes
    start condition stacks
    interactive/non-interactive scanners
    yy_scan_string() and friends
    yyterminate()
    yy_set_interactive()
    yy_set_bol()
    YY_AT_BOL()
    &lt;&lt;EOF&gt;&gt;
    &lt;*&gt;
    YY_DECL
    YY_START
    YY_USER_ACTION
    YY_USER_INIT
    #line directives
    %{}&#39;s around actions
    multiple actions on a line
</code></pre>

<p>plus almost all of the flex flags. The last feature in the list refers
to the fact that with <code>flex</code> you can put multiple actions on
the same line, separated with semi-colons, while with <code>lex</code>,
the following

<pre><code>
    foo    handle_foo(); ++num_foos_seen;
</code></pre>

<p>is (rather surprisingly) truncated to

<pre><code>
    foo    handle_foo();
</code></pre>

<p><code>flex</code> does not truncate the action. Actions that are not
enclosed in braces are simply terminated at the end of the line.

<h1 id="diagnostics">DIAGNOSTICS</h1>

<p><code>warning, rule cannot be matched</code> indicates that the given
rule cannot be matched because it follows other rules that will always
match the same text as it. For example, in the following "foo" cannot
be matched because it comes after an identifier "catch-all" rule:

<pre><code>
    [a-z]+    got_identifier();
    foo       got_foo();
</code></pre>

<p>Using <code>REJECT</code> in a scanner suppresses this warning.

<p><code>warning, -s option given but default rule can be matched</code>
means that it is possible (perhaps only in a particular
start condition) that the default rule (match any single character) is
the only one that will match a particular input. Since <code>-s</code>
was given, presumably this is not intended.

<p><code>reject_used_but_not_detected undefined</code> or
<code>yymore_used_but_not_detected undefined</code>- These errors can occur
at compile time. They indicate that the scanner uses <code>REJECT</code>
or <code>yymore()</code> but that <code>flex</code> failed to notice the
fact, meaning that <code>flex</code> scanned the first two sections
looking for occurrences of these actions and failed to find any,
but somehow you snuck some in (via a #include file, for example). Use
<code>%option reject</code> or <code>%option yymore</code> to indicate
to flex that you really do use these features.

<p><code>flex scanner jammed</code>-  a scanner compiled with <code>-s</code>
has encountered an input string which wasn't matched by any of its
rules. This error can also occur due to internal problems.

<p><code>token too large, exceeds YYLMAX</code>-  your scanner uses
<code>%array</code> and one of its rules matched a string longer than
the <code>YYLMAX</code> constant (8K bytes by default). You can increase
the value by #define'ing <code>YYLMAX</code> in the definitions section
of your <code>flex</code> input.

<p><code>scanner requires -8 flag to use the character 'x'</code>-
Your scanner specification includes recognizing the 8-bit
character <code>'x'</code> and you did not specify the -8 flag, and your
scanner defaulted to 7-bit because you used the <code>-Cf</code> or
<code>-CF</code> table compression options. See the discussion of the
<code>-7</code> flag for details.

<p><code>flex scanner push-back overflow</code>-  you used
<code>unput()</code> to push back so much text that the scanner's
buffer could not hold both the pushed-back text and the current token
in <code>yytext</code>. Ideally the scanner should dynamically resize
the buffer in this case, but at present it does not.

<p><code>input buffer overflow, can't enlarge buffer because scanner uses REJECT</code>-
the scanner was working on matching an extremely large
token and needed to expand the input buffer. This doesn't work with
scanners that use <code>REJECT</code>.

<p><code>fatal flex scanner internal error--end of buffer missed</code>-
This can occur in an scanner which is reentered after a long-jump has
jumped out (or over) the scanner's activation frame. Before reentering
the scanner, use:

<pre><code>
    yyrestart( yyin );
</code></pre>

<p>or, as noted above, switch to using the C++ scanner class.

<p><code>too many start conditions in &lt;&gt; construct!</code>-  you listed
more start conditions in a &lt;&gt; construct than exist (so you must
have listed at least one of them twice).

<h1 id="deficiencies-n-bugs">DEFICIENCIES / BUGS</h1>

<p>Some trailing context patterns cannot be properly matched and generate
warning messages ("dangerous trailing context"). These are patterns
where the ending of the first part of the rule matches the beginning
of the second part, such as "zx*/xy*", where the 'x*' matches the 'x'
at the beginning of the trailing context. (Note that the POSIX draft
states that the text matched by such patterns is undefined.)

<p>For some trailing context rules, parts which are actually fixed-length
are not recognized as such, leading to the abovementioned performance
loss. In particular, parts using '|' or {n} (such as "foo{3}") are always
considered variable-length.

<p>Combining trailing context with the special '|' action can result
in <em>fixed</em> trailing context being turned into the more expensive
<em>variable</em> trailing context. For example, in the following:

<pre><code>
    %%
    abc      |
    xyz/def
</code></pre>

<p>Use of <code>unput()</code> invalidates yytext and yyleng, unless the
<code>%array</code> directive or the <code>-l</code> option has been used.

<p>Pattern-matching of NUL's is substantially slower than matching
other characters.

<p>Dynamic resizing of the input buffer is slow, as it entails rescanning
all the text matched so far by the current (generally huge) token.

<p>Due to both buffering of input and read-ahead, you cannot
intermix calls to &lt;stdio.h&gt; routines, such as, for example,
<code>getchar()</code>, with <code>flex</code> rules and expect it to
work. Call <code>input()</code> instead.

<p>The total table entries listed by the <code>-v</code> flag excludes
the number of table entries needed to determine what rule has been
matched. The number of entries is equal to the number of DFA states if
the scanner does not use <code>REJECT</code>, and somewhat greater than
the number of states if it does.

<p><code>REJECT</code> cannot be used with the <code>-f</code> or
<code>-F</code> options.

<p>The <code>flex</code> internal algorithms need documentation.
